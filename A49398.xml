            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But becauſe a very worthy deſign may miſcarry in the contrivance and method of its proſecution, therefore I think my ſelf oblig'd to give you ſome account of that: which is thus, I have endeavour'd to repreſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>frantick</hi> and <hi>conceited Whimſies</hi> which others deform it by: I have propos'd the <hi>glorious Motives</hi> to Holineſs, and the powerful <hi>Remedies</hi> againſt Temptation which it contains. I have perform'd this as near as I could, in an eaſie Method and familiar Stile: I have not intermixt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fancy</hi> or <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which ſeems to me too light and gariſh a dreſs for Divine thoughts, but writ them in as natural a plainneſs and Majeſty as I could give them, hoping all from the conquering power and influence of clear truth, and therefore it will be neceſſary, to him who ſhall deſign any advantage to himſelf from this Treatiſe, to read it delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and allow each ſentence a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Conſideration; for being forc'd to crowd many Truths into a narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, I have wove the matter a little cloſſer, and choſe a conciſer Stile, than otherwiſe I ſhould have done; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not expect to be betray'd by me into a <hi>wiſe Love</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, or to be heated into a <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Paſſion</hi> for Vertue, the former is impoſſible, and the latter of little uſe; but if you bring an <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>

mind, I hope you may find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Diſcourſe which may be of very important ſervice to your Soul. And beſides this I had one inducement more to the Publication of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, that is, I am ſufficiently aſſur'd that no kind of Diſcourſes contribute more to the peace and welfare of Church and State than thoſe practical ones, which aim at implanting a real goodneſs in the minds of men, for the want of this goodneſs is it which hath betraid us into Errors ſo <hi>numerous</hi> and ſo <hi>fatal</hi> to the publique Peace, and Charity, and to the very vitals of Religion; for if our minds were poſſeſs'd with that <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and true <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Divine Glory, which becomes <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> we ſhould conſider more <hi>calmly,</hi> and ſee more <hi>clearly,</hi> and act more <hi>ſincerely;</hi> we ſhould diſcern a more manifeſt contradiction to Religion in thoſe unnatural Feuds, which are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by ſo much paſſion in ſuch ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious methods, and made uſe of to ſuch unchriſtian purpoſes, than in any thing, which is the ſubject of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts; and we ſhould follow after peace

And ſince I have ſuch a Soul ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Happineſs or Miſery, it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follows, that it were ſottiſh and unreaſonable to <hi>loſe</hi> this Soul for the <hi>gain</hi> of the whole World: For my Soul is <hi>I my ſelf,</hi> and if <hi>That</hi> be miſerable <hi>I</hi> muſt needs be ſo; outward circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Fortune may give the World oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to <hi>think</hi> me happy, but they can never <hi>make</hi> me ſo; Shall I call my ſelf happy, if Diſcontent and Sorrow eat out the life and ſpirit of my Soul, if luſts and paſſions riot and mutiny in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, if my ſins ſcatter an uneaſie ſhame all o're me, and my guilt apales and frights me? what avails it me, that my Rooms are ſtately, my tables full, my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendanrs numerous, and my attire gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if all this while my very <hi>Being</hi> pines and languiſhes away? <hi>Theſe</hi> indeed are rich and pleaſant things, but I never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs am poor and miſerable Man: Therefore I conclude, that whatever this thing be I call a Soul, tho it were a periſhing, dying thing, and would not out-live the Body, yet it were my wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

This very Conſideration, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the uncertainty of another World, would yet ſtrongly engage me to the ſervice of Religion, for all <hi>it</hi> aims at is to baniſh ſin out of the world, which is the ſource and Original of all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that diſquiet the mind; for 1. Sin in its very Eſſence is nothing elſe but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, diſtempered paſſions, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fooliſh and prepoſterous in their choice, or wild and extravagant in their proportion, which our own experience ſufficiently convinces us, to be painful and uneaſie. 2. It engages us in deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hazards, wearies us with daily toils, and often buries us in the ruins we bring upon our ſelves: and laſtly it fills our hearts with diſtruſt, and fear, and ſhame; for we ſhall never be able to perſwade our ſelves <hi>fully,</hi> that there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between good and evil, that there is no God, or none that concerns himſelf at the Actions of this life; and if we cannot, we can never rid our

ſelves of the pangs and ſtings of a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Soul: we ſhall never be able to eſtabliſh a peace and calm in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, and ſo injoy our Pleaſure with a clear and uninterrupted freedome. But if we could perſwade ourſelves into the utmoſt height of Atheiſm, yet ſtill we ſhall be under theſe two ſtrange inconveniences. 1. That a life of Sin will be ſtill irregular and diſorderly, and therefore troubleſome. 2. That we ſhall have diſmantled our Souls of their greateſt ſtrengths, diſarm'd them of that Faith, which only can ſupport them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der th' afflictions of this preſent Life;</p>
                  <p>Not to mention, that after all; the ſad Stories of another Life will not be ſtrait way nonſenſe, becauſe we <hi>think</hi> them ſo, they will continue at leaſtwiſe diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and who would, but a deſperate-Sot, commit his Soul to ſuch a venture!</p>

                  <p>But I muſt purſue this thought a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further, and not ſtopping in the contemplation of <hi>the uſeleſsneſs</hi> of the World after the Souls departure from it, go on to conſider the Soul in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate ſtate between Death and the

                  <p>This is the natural and unavoydable ſtate of a wretched Soul, diſlodg'd from the body; deſpair, and rage, and ſhame, and guilt, and fear, and grief, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, gnaw and devour the miſerable creature, and for ever muſt encreaſe: Bleſſed God! need there any chains to ſink it lower than its own weight hath done? Needs there any other darkneſs cover that Soul, which ſuch a cloud of ſorrows hath benighted? Tell me no more of pleaſures, theſe thoughts are enough to make me tremble, and grow pale at the approach of a temptation; rather than my Soul ſhould dwell in ſuch a ſtate a thouſand years, may ſhame and poverty be my portion in this life, may the hatred of powerful enemies, or what is worſe, the ſcorn of my deareſt

                  <p>In my Creed, I have regard to three things eſpecially. 1. To the uſe and end of Faith, which is certainly to guide and influence our lives. 2. To the peace of my own Breaſt. And 3. To the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Charity: My Reaſon for the firſt, is evident of it ſelf; for the two later, is this: Tho I may doubt whether I believe aright all that is neceſſary to my eternal ſalvation, and yet that doubt not prove injurious to my happineſs at the laſt day, becauſe I did both believe aright and live conformably to it, and the ſcruple aroſe only from the Diſputes and Conteſts of men, and the weakneſs of my own underſtanding, not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42889:12"/>
iniquity of my will; yet this doubt will diſquiet and diſturb my repoſe, damp my cheerfulneſs and vigour, and may peradventure unſettle my faith, and end, if not in Atheiſm, in coldneſs and indifferency:</p>
                  <p>And tho 2. I may believe <hi>Another</hi> in a damnable Errour, when he is not, without prejudice to my own Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I may make this judgement in the Simplicity of my heart, by the beſt light and Rule I have; yet peradventure this opinion may improve it ſelf inſenſibly upon my affections, to a very ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and invite me to an uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unfriendly deportment.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) If <hi>I</hi> conſider the Chriſtian Faith with regard to the great end of it, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs, I</hi> obſerve that the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains two great things, the <hi>Knowledge of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt; This is Life eternal,</hi> Joh. 17.3. <hi>To know thee the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> This knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it all the <hi>Obligations</hi> imaginable to <hi>a Holy Life,</hi> and <hi>ſecures</hi> the <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>comforts</hi> of Chriſtians upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable foundation; and this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42889:12"/>
agrees perfectly with the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>With the Nature of Religion.</hi> Religion is nothing elſe but the true and ſpiritual worſhip of the only true God, who is a Spirit: Now all the worſhip we are capable of paying him, conſiſts either in the <hi>Affections</hi> of the Soul, or <hi>Actions</hi> of the Body; ſo that that Belief or Knowledge which tends to render theſe proper and acceptable to God, is directly conformable to the Nature of Religion; The Goſpel therefore hath diſcovered God to us 1. <hi>One,</hi> infinite in <hi>Wiſedom, Power, Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Goodneſs,</hi> &amp;c. And ſecondly, as he ſtands more particularly related to us in the Work of Creation, Providence, Redemption. All this put together proves him to be <hi>God,</hi> and to be <hi>Ours;</hi> it evinces his <hi>Excellency</hi> and his <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy;</hi> it repreſents him infinitely <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Adorable</hi> in himſelf, and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles him to all the ſervice and affection, which <hi>Dominion, Love,</hi> and <hi>Munificence</hi> can lay a juſt claim to, all which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement enough (which is the uſe of Faith) to our Duty, when we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42889:13"/>Which that we might be, and that we might have aſſiſtance to enable us to performe it, and that there might be a Proviſion made for the pardon of our errors, God in his infinite wiſedom thought it neceſſary to ſend his Son into the world, and therefore it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to eternal Life to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent; and about <hi>him</hi> we are inform'd in the Goſpel, that he is the Son of God; that he was made Man, and liv'd here upon Earth, that he might teach us our Duty, and leave us an Example of it; that he was crucified for our ſins; that he roſe again from the Dead, and after forty dayes ſojourning here, he was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into glory, and became the Head and Prince of his Church, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Belief of all which, illuſtrates the Juſtice and Mercy of the Moſt High God: aſſures us of the truth of his promiſes, <hi>i. e.</hi> The <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of the Spirit of God, and eternal Rewards; and ſuperadds moſt powerful Obligations to obedience, and layes an unſhaken foundation of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> by ſhewing us on what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our ſins are pardon'd, and our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42889:13"/>
ſervices accepted. So that now there will need but few words to prove</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this knowledge doth direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve the <hi>End and Aims of Religion,</hi> which muſt be <hi>Gods Glory</hi> and <hi>Mans Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> the former is already prov'd, for to <hi>Glorifie</hi> and to <hi>Worſhip</hi> God are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent terms; the later eaſily appears thus, in that this Belief doth. 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue us from <hi>the power</hi> of ſin, by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful motives, and endearments, to and by ſupernatural aſſiſtances of virtue, and 2. From the <hi>guilt</hi> of it by the Blood of Chriſt; and ſo it frees us from the miſery of unruly paſſions, and from the ſlaviſh Fears of Death and Hell: 3. It compoſes our minds in all the various changes of the world, by the firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the wiſedom, power, and goodneſs of the God who governs it; And laſtly, it delights and ſatisfies our Souls by the diſcovery of Objects fit for their love and enjoyment; which is no leſs eſſentially neceſſary to our preſent happineſs than any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for Man being a weak and empty Creature, cannot like God, find his happineſs in the <hi>fruition</hi> of <hi>himſelf,</hi> but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42889:14"/>
muſt ſeek it in ſomething elſe, which muſt be able to fill all his deſires and appetites, and ſatisfie all his Capacities of enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>O Happy Chriſtian, that conquers the World and himſelf, that is freed from all fears and jealouſies about a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, and enjoys the raviſhing Objects of a glorious Faith; well may the Holy Spirit make up the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this State, of characters of Joy, Peace, and Hope.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But now Secondly, that this Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs may be intire, it is neeſſary to ſecure <hi>the peace of my</hi> own boſome, as to the matters of Faith: And this may be diſturbed two wayes, either by doubting of the <hi>Truth,</hi> or elſe the <hi>Sence</hi> of Divine Revelation: we are tempted to the former commonly by this Argument, <hi>Theſe things cannot be, therefore the Book, which contains the Hiſtory of them, is an impoſture.</hi> To the later, by much the ſame Argument, <hi>Theſe things cannot be therefore</hi> (ſince we cannot deny the authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) we muſt explain them in ſome other ſenſe: Both proceed upon this

                  </p>
                  <p>To ſecure my ſelf from the firſt of theſe, I conſider the infinite Majeſty of the God we worſhip, and the trifling dwarfiſh Capacities of us Men, and then I wonder not, that ſome Articles ſhould rather <hi>ſurpriſe</hi> and <hi>dazle</hi> my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties than <hi>enlighten</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>To expect otherwiſe, were to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the nature of myſteries, and of my ſelf; it is true, to believe without a Reaſon for it, is Credulity not Faith, but then Revelation is the higheſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the belief of things ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, there being no other mean left us to attain to their knowledge; ſo that all that Reaſon can have to do here, is not to diſcuſs the <hi>probability</hi> of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle revealed, but the <hi>Authority</hi> of the revelation, and this being once clear'd, to ſurrender up our doubts and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: which is (weighing the ſhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our underſtandings, and the depths of myſteries) no more than in a tedious long journey, our eyes being dim, and the way unknown and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,

to abandon our ſelves to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a kind, skillful, and faithful Guide. The Sum of all is this, Man is born like a wild Aſſes Colt, and arrives into a rational Creature by painful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and ſlow progreſſions, the Soul being clouded by Paſſions, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd and limited by ſcanty Organs, perverted by unhappy prejudices; and therefore 'tis a very wild, and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant piece of folly, to make ones own underſtanding the great ſtandard and meaſure of <hi>all truth,</hi> or to determine, that the utmoſt of our Fancy is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent of Nature and of the Deity too; for on the other hand, God is a great and <hi>incomprehenſible</hi> Being, <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be prais'd, and his greatneſs is unſearchable,</hi> Pſal. 145.3. and therefore by a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, our Faith is not the leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, becauſe it is the more <hi>reſign'd,</hi> an awful diſtance and a modeſt Faith is as eſſential a part of Holineſs, as the conformity of our Wills to the Divine Law.

of Revelation, for the received and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſenſe appears to be the more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and obvious, and therefore no objection lies againſt it, but what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready remov'd, the ſeeming impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it: and if it be further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that the Goſpel was addreſs'd to perſons of very ordinary endowments; and therefore to be underſtood in its moſt obvious ſenſe; that it is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to that humble infant Spirit Chriſt requires in his Diſciples to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie them for the reception of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to Believe rather than Diſpute: That the receiv'd ſenſe is the ſenſe of the whole Catholick Church. That an Errour of judgement, which ſprings from Humility not Pride, will be rather pitied than puniſh'd by a good God, this all together will eaſily raiſe my Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all ſcruple and wavering: Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if I add to all this, this one Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the Adverſaries of any one Article of Faith, have never made up one entire Body, but ſeveral Sects, divided by numerous and contradictory Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, built up upon different Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they have never been able to

propagate any thing but wild and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable fancies; that they have ſet Scripture at a more irreconcileable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from it ſelf, and inſtead of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its myſterious ſenſes, have made its plaineſt ſenſe a Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>From all this I am oblig'd to reſolve, not to gaze, and ſtare upon Majeſty, leſt I be blinded by the ſhine of it; but worſhip and adore, that I may be bleſt by it. I'le look upon my Creed like the Ark of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.

                  <p>If after all this I chance to Err, I do not doubt, but that the purity of my intention, the diligence of my inquiry, the meekneſs and intireneſs of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, will, through the mercies and goodneſs of a gracious God, ſecure my Heaven, and render my error innocent and harmleſs.

                        <hi>GLorious and incomprehenſible God, ſuppreſs in me all proud thoughts, all wild and wanton Curioſities, and keep my Soul in the humble frame of new born Babes! Thou dwelleſt in Light inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, my Soul in a cloud of Fleſh and Bloud; my Faculties are weak and taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thy Light dazling; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not for me, Lord, it is not for me, ſaucily to diſcuſs, or pragmatically to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of, but humbly to receive, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to embrace thoſe Myſteries, which thou a God of Truth, of Goodneſs, and of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, haſt vouchſaf'd to reveal to us by the Son of thy Boſome; Lord, I confeſs, that tho theſe Mysteries have a dark, they have a bright ſide too, for tho I cannot ſee thorow them, yet I ſee enough to oblige me to worſhip Thee in Humility and Love, and theſe, theſe, I hope, will ſecure me in thy Love through Chriſt. Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, help thou mine unbelief; enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en my blindneſs! quicken and enliven my dulneſs! ſupport my frailties! diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe my Paſſions! free me from all the

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I have conſider'd the Chriſtian Faith, and ſecur'd my own Peace: But there are multitudes of People of a lower Rank and Capacity, who may not, it may be, reach the deſign of this Section, who are diſtracted by the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Controverſies every where on foot, and frightned by the raſh zeal of their Abetters: For the ſatisfaction of ſuch, I conſider,</p>
                     <p>That it is eaſie to deduce from the Goſpel, That the Almighty will judge men by their ſeveral meaſures and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. 2. That the great Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Religion are clear as day light, and therefore the Goſpel is call'd <hi>Light,</hi> and the Grace of God is ſaid to appear unto all men, which (tho I ſuppoſe primarily meant in oppoſition to the darkneſs of Gentiliſm, and in ſome meaſure of Judaiſm too, and to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42889:18"/>
that narrower limitation of this Grace under the Moſaical Oeconomy) implies with all the clearneſs of the Goſpel, of which were there no other proof, this one would ſuffice, That the Goſpel was deſign'd for the benefit of all Mankind, and more immediately preach'd to the Poor, and Silly, and Refuſe of the World: The conſequence of this is, that it ſeems at leaſt to me, wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that any Body ſhould be betray'd into a neceſſity of Erring in Fundamentals, unleſs they be acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their own error, and therefore this being once granted, I may reſolve all I can think of neceſſary for the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in to two directions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That holding faſt to manifeſt Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, they for the reſt ſubmit themſelves to the Government they are under, which will be ſafe for them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three Accounts. 1. That the points controverted are ſuch, which <hi>they</hi> are not of neceſſity oblig'd to know. 2. That <hi>they</hi> themſelves are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making any ſolid inquiry, and therefore to reſign themſelves to thoſe ſet over them, is the utmoſt of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42889:19"/>
3. That in this Caſe their ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the publick Authority of the Church they are of, is an act of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Humility, and moſt conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the command of God, and the peace and unity of the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they never prefer a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful opinion to the prejudice of a plain Precept or Duty; a Man may go to Heaven tho he be not of this or that opinion, but without Obedience and Charity he cannot; but to do this, is to ſtickle for a Sect, in violation of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Charity, and to prefer an humor before ones Duty, which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Symptom of a mind infatuated by pride, or perverted by intereſt.</p>

                  <p>We are born into a World full of <hi>Snares</hi> and <hi>Temptations;</hi> and we our ſelves are Creatures <hi>blind,</hi> and yet <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; weak</hi> and yet <hi>wanton</hi> too: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe accounts we are vouchſaf'd the favour of Divine Revelation; to conduct us thorow our Pilgrimage, to enable us to fight the good fight of Faith, and to prevent our miſcarrying thorow the Deceitfulneſs of Sin, and the frailty of humane nature: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoever doth not improve this gift of God, into all theſe Advantages and Benefits, defeats the deſign of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and receives the grace of God in vain.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all this, the great Author of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42889:20"/>
all things hath declar'd himſelf a God <hi>jealous of his honour,</hi> and <hi>delighted in the happineſs of his Creatures;</hi> from whence I naturally infer, that <hi>that</hi> only can be a deſign worthy of Chriſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent into Earth, which promotes the <hi>Glory</hi> of God and the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of Man, and that is only Goodneſs or Holineſs, concerning which I will</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Enquire what kind of Goodneſs or Holineſs that is, which the Goſpel of Chriſt requires: And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prove that it tends to advance the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, and <hi>Happineſs</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; which will ſerve not onely as a proof of its being the ſcope and drift of Chriſtianity, but alſo for a ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, and motive to it.</p>
                  <p>Of the 1. Holineſs is compriz'd in three things, <hi>living ſoberly, righteouſly, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in this preſent world, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. That hereby is forbid all plain and open viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Commandements; ſuch as are. 1. All <hi>debaſing</hi> of God in our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and deprav'd Acts of worſhip conſequent to this, and all unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him. 2. All ſorts of Falſhood and Injuſtice. 3. All kind of <hi>unnatural</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:42889:20"/>
Luſts, and Exceſs, deſtructive to our <hi>Health</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> is too plain to be prov'd: All this being nothing elſe but <hi>that ungodlineſs</hi> and <hi>Worldly Luſts which we are to deny,</hi> and the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens by the Light of Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. <hi>Knowing, that they who do ſuch things are worthy of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whether <hi>Chriſtian Holineſs</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports any thing more than the mere <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding</hi> thoſe Sins, upon the principles and aſſiſtances <hi>of Religion;</hi> whether the poſitive part of the command in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Verſe, doth not intend ſomething more, than the negative in the former part of it, is very well worth our Conſideration; becauſe it is plain that the Scripture ſpeaking with reſpect to the Life of Gentiles which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd even below the Light of Nature, doth by mortification moſtly intend an abſtinence from thoſe actions amongſt them, which were manifeſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Law: <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the Earth, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5.

Chriſtianity themſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to others under the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a <hi>Debonnair</hi> and <hi>Complaiſant</hi> Religion, ſo that the way to Life ſeems to me ſo exceeding <hi>broad,</hi> and the Gate ſo very <hi>wide,</hi> that unleſs a Man be born with a moſt <hi>villainous temper,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> be improv'd by a <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>undiſciplin'd Education,</hi> a Man may make a ſhift to enter in without much <hi>ſtriving</hi> or <hi>ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> which ſeems to me very oppoſite to the meaning of our Saviour. I will therefore anſwer to this Quere by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: Having firſt remov'd the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by telling you. 1. That <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> is but one part of Chriſtian Holineſs, and that <hi>Abſtinence</hi> from groſs Sin is but half of Mortification: And 2. That, I hope, they who ſpeak ſuch ſoft things of Chriſtianity, do intend it of a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> pleaſure, or elſe of that more perfect State, wherein they who are arriv'd at it <hi>know how to abound;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe having obtain'd a more compleat conqueſt over the Body and the world, they are not ſo eaſily enſnar'd as new Converts: And I proceed now to the Query it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42889:21"/>1. Acts of Sobriety and Juſtice, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd without any deliberation by the meer inclination of Nature, (if ſuch may be) are meerly <hi>natural</hi> Actions, neither good nor evil; neither reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nor puniſhable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Acts of Sobriety and Juſtice, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd upon the ſole inſtigation of <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> and <hi>conveniency,</hi> which attends ſuch a Life in this preſent world, are very proper and natural effects of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but under the Goſpel they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute any parts of the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> becauſe <hi>our</hi> Actions are to proceed from <hi>nobler</hi> Motives; not that I deny, but that to <hi>us</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>Worldly Happyneſs</hi> may be a very lawful incentive to Holineſs, but then it muſt be in its place, not the ſole and great, but a ſubordinate inducement. Thus tho the Apoſtle invites us to goodneſs by <hi>Praiſe</hi> and a <hi>Good Report,</hi> yet he, who is <hi>vertuous</hi> meerly that he may be <hi>fam'd</hi> for it, is a vain-glorious Sinner; ſo though the promiſes of <hi>this Life</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to Godlineſs, may encourage us to embrace it, yet if any Man be godly meerly for preſent pleaſure and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42889:22"/>
of this Life, he is but a <hi>Worldly</hi> Man; nor do I here only mean, that worldly pleaſure muſt not be the <hi>ſole,</hi> but that it muſt not be the <hi>great,</hi> the <hi>principal</hi> allurement to Religion; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing it may contribute, but it muſt be in its place and its Degree: and thus far I have treated the Quere with more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour than I ſhould, by making uſe of the words <hi>Acts of Sobriety and Juſtice,</hi> which is not taken for granted in the Queſtion; and now I muſt premiſe once for all, that a meer <hi>abſtinence</hi> from evil is not a <hi>Doing,</hi> or <hi>Being good,</hi> and then I proceed to reſolve</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That to deny any Sin upon the account of Religion, <hi>i. e.</hi> The Fear and Love of God, and Hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is certainly <hi>an</hi> acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; but becauſe in all our Actions there are generally many motives twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and becauſe Man out of <hi>fondneſs</hi> for himſelf is very apt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the work, to that motive which it is his intereſt ſhould be uppermoſt; therefore it will very nearly concern every one, to examine ſeriouſly the degrees and ſtrength of this Faith he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42889:22"/>
pretends to; for peradventure, tho this Faith be ſtrong enough to reſtrain him from <hi>wild and unnatural Luſts,</hi> becauſe it leaves him enjoyments and pleaſures enough to entertain him with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in their ſtead; and gives him up to a Life no leſs <hi>ſenſual,</hi> tho the inſtances of ſenſuality be more <hi>regular:</hi> Yet it may not be powerful enough to cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all worldly and carnal affections, and to force him to do perfect violence to his Inclinations: His fondneſs for the pleaſures of this Life may be too ſtubborn to give way to a Faith, which is not more <hi>deeply rooted,</hi> nor arm'd and wing'd with holy <hi>paſſion;</hi> and the Body may be too high fed to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up all its ſatisfactions upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of a drowſie Faith; ſo that the Man doth not <hi>intirely</hi> deny <hi>himſelf</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Religion commands it; but thus far he thinks fit to <hi>comply</hi> with Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it doth him no harm, it doth not intrench upon his <hi>ſenſual injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> and if this be his Caſe, tho the Man may have call'd in Faith to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Reaſon, yet he doth not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to reign, and by conſequence his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42889:23"/>
Life is ſtill the Life of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and not of <hi>Faith.</hi> Faith comes in but ſlanting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and collaterally into his Life, it is not the main and chief inducement to his Actions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, A Life lead in meer <hi>abſtinence</hi> from evil, and yet an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the utmoſt freedomes we can with innocence injoy (upon ſuppoſal that ſuch a Man could ſo love God and Heaven, as to be able to renounce all, when call'd thereto, a ſuppoſition I can very difficultly be reconcil'd to) is but the <hi>minimum morale;</hi> if Holineſs, yet the loweſt degree of it; and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſeems to me to have a further aim, to propoſe a greater height, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from its Votaries a nobler <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> which will eaſily appear to any one who ſhall diligently conſider. 1. The <hi>great Motives</hi> to Holyneſs, which it contains, that is, a declaration of the Divine Nature, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.18.

and Divine Providence, employed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>preventing</hi> us from falling into temptations too big for this imperfect ſtate, or elſe in finding a way to our <hi>eſcape</hi> out of them: Or Thirdly, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate end of Chriſtian Religion, that is whilſt we are here on <hi>Earth</hi> to fit us for <hi>Heaven:</hi> He that ſhall ſeriouſly lay to heart theſe three things will be forc'd to conclude, that in all reaſon, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel muſt require of us ſomething pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the extraordinary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the powerful aſſiſtances, and the glorious end it aſſures and propoſes to its Children, and this muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a meer <hi>negative</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; for it is unreaſonable, that this <hi>Light</hi> ſhould beget in us no greater degrees of Love and Fear for God, than what <hi>natural Reaſon</hi> might; or if it doth, that the <hi>inſtances</hi> of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>now under the Goſpel,</hi> ſhould be only ſuch, as the ſtrength of nature might have enabled men to comply with <hi>under Gentiliſm,</hi> tho it muſt be confeſt not ſo eaſily as now.</p>

(which is the Rule and Standard of the Chriſtian Life) ſets us as a more <hi>exalted</hi> patern: Not onely to be <hi>True</hi> in our words, and <hi>Juſt</hi> in our dealings with our Neighbour, but to be <hi>Charitable, Gentle, Patient,</hi> and to return <hi>good</hi> for <hi>evil</hi> to our very Enemies: not only to avoid all <hi>unnatural Luſts</hi> and <hi>wild Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,</hi> but alſo to be <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> to admit of no <hi>ſenſual Fancy</hi> or <hi>unchaſt Looks,</hi> or idle words, to <hi>faſt</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict</hi> our ſelves <hi>(the Bleſſed are they which mourn)</hi> he forbids us all <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Vainglory,</hi> not on the account of <hi>injuſtice,</hi> for <hi>that</hi> doth not alwayes unavoidably cleave to them, but as they are the Acts of a <hi>worldly mind,</hi> which is perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>poverty of Spirit,</hi> and to <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our Treaſures in Heaven,</hi> and to <hi>the taking up of the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> ſo powerfully and ſweetly recommended. Our duty to God is couch'd all along in the whole Diſcourſe, but the Acts of worſhip more plainly expreſs'd, are <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> him as a Father, <hi>praying</hi> to him, endeavouring to promote <hi>his Glory,</hi> and chearfully to <hi>obey</hi> his will, <hi>relying</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:42889:24"/>
upon him for aſſiſtance in our <hi>ſpiritual</hi> warfare, for <hi>Proviſion, Protection,</hi> and Deliverance in this Life; and add to all this, this one circumſtance, that all this is to be done with <hi>delight, conſtancy,</hi> and <hi>vigour,</hi> (implied in thoſe general Precepts, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Lay up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for where your treaſure is there will your Heart be alſo, ſeek you firſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſtrive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> &amp;c.) and then you have our Saviours Senſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Holineſs;</p>
                  <p>If we conſult his Diſciples, the beſt Expoſitors of their Maſters Text, we ſhall find the whole of Religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd in two things. The <hi>Mortific<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> of the <hi>outward Man,</hi> and <hi>the Reſurrection of the inward,</hi> by which they mean, as appears from <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. <hi>a ſetting our affections upon things above, and not upon things on the Earth,</hi> from whence I will infer two concluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That our affections are an eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part of Holineſs, that it is not enough to <hi>approve</hi> of <hi>inviſible things</hi> in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and then <hi>act</hi> not as Men, who love God, and Heaven, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42889:25"/>
but as men, who ſee it unavoidably <hi>neceſſary</hi> to do ſomething, and therefore go as far as is conſiſtent with that <hi>carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> they yet reſolve to gratifie; but that we muſt <hi>love</hi> them alſo; and this to that degree may be able to extinguiſh our <hi>paſſion</hi> for the <hi>World,</hi> and therefore.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Life we are to lead, muſt be ſuch a one as may moſt tend to enkindle in us <hi>holy paſſions</hi> for the things above, a <hi>delight</hi> in the ſurvey of our hopes, <hi>and defires</hi> of entring into the preſence of God; all which cannot be attain'd but by requent <hi>Prayer, Meditation Hearing,</hi> and <hi>Reading</hi> of Gods Word, the holy <hi>Communion,</hi> and heavenly <hi>Diſcourſes:</hi> and on the other ſide to <hi>take off our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> from the world, and beget in us a generous <hi>contempt</hi> of it, which can never be effected, but by repeated acts of <hi>ſelf denyal, faſting, watching, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating,</hi> on the example of a <hi>crucified</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the <hi>glories</hi> and <hi>pleaſures</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life, the <hi>vanity</hi> and yet <hi>bewitche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of this fadeing one; I may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that a conſtant careſſing the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with feaſting, drinking, wanton dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, the pomp and vanities of Life
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42889:25"/>
cannot be a proper method to the <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> of the outward man or <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vification</hi> of the inward;</p>
                  <p>So that if a very <hi>abſtenious Life</hi> (as to the general courſe of it) be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, as an eſſential part of Holineſs, yet it is neceſſary as the means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of it: conformable to this whole diſcourſe is that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 7, 29.30. <hi>But this I ſay Brethren, the time is ſhort; it remaineth that both they that have wives be as tho they had none, and they that weep as tho they wept not; and they that rejoice, as tho they rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not, and they that buy as tho they poſſeſs'd not; and they that uſe this world as not abuſing it, for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away:</hi> where we are not only interdicted unlawful pleaſures, but forbidden to give our ſelves up to lawful ones; and commanded to uſe ſuch <hi>moderation</hi> as may become men ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded of the <hi>ſhortneſs and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of this Life, and poſſeſs'd by the expectations of a <hi>better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sum of all is this, The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an State, is a State of <hi>extraordinary Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Purity;</hi> 'tis a <hi>new nature,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:42889:26"/>
wrought by <hi>principles, motives, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,</hi> different from thoſe of the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> man; 'tis, in one word, to be <hi>Heavenly minded;</hi> and therefore that courſe of Life, which can beſt ſerve to encreaſe this bleſſed temper, is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Duty; and that courſe which quenches it, which <hi>ſoftens</hi> and <hi>ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizes</hi> us, is inconſiſtent with Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and inconſiſtent with Regeneration; for if we be riſen with Chriſt we ſhall not onely <hi>Love,</hi> but <hi>ſeek</hi> thoſe things, which are above; it being impoſſible for any man to live, (when he can chooſe) quite contrary to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; ſo that he who loves God, need not be told, that he muſt <hi>Pray,</hi> and <hi>Meditate,</hi> and <hi>Communicate,</hi> and be <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good,</hi> &amp;c. When he knows he can enjoy him here below no way elſe; he that hates Sin, and loves Holineſs, needs not be told that he muſt lead an abſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious Life, when he knows that feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do feed the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into wantonneſs and luſt, and quench the holy flame of Love, and indiſpoſe it for Religious Duties.</p>
                  <p>From all this it is plain. Religion is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42889:26"/>
in its eſſence an inward and ſpiritual Holineſs, outward actions can be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered but two wayes, either as the <hi>means</hi> and <hi>inſtruments,</hi> or elſe as the <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of Holineſs; and both ways a ſober temperate Life (as to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral courſe of it) is indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; tho I cannot here deny, but that there muſt be an allowance made for the <hi>variety of Tempers,</hi> and the <hi>different ſtrengths</hi> of grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to each mans different caſe.</p>
                  <p>Having thus given an Account of the nature of the Holineſs which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel requires, I come</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew that it tends to promote <hi>Gods Glory</hi> and <hi>Mans Happineſs.</hi> 1. <hi>Gods Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though a right underſtanding be wholly neceſſary to, yet it ſelf is no part of Divine worſhip; it is not meer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or belief of a truth, but Love, and Fear, and Obedience by which we honour God, and devote our ſelves to him; there is no where more light of knowledge (Heaven excepted) than in thoſe Regions of darkneſs where the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42889:27"/>
moſt impious Spirits dwell, but no body will ſay that they there worſhip God; 'tis true an underſtanding illuminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is certainly a beautiful thing, but then if it be joyn'd to an unſanctified will, the Man in the whole is the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd and loathſome thing imaginable, for he is made up of two the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable and contradictory things, as if he were formed as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et fancies men, growing out of the ſlime of the Deluge, the upper parts enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened fleſh and bloud, the lower mud and clay; the light of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enhaunces the guilt of malice and degeneracy in the Will; for to ſee God, and not love and obey him is ſtrangely malicious, but if his beauty be not ador'd by things that have no eyes to ſee it, 'tis not to be wondred at. <hi>If you had been blind, then had you had no ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Heavens,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>declare the glory of God, &amp;c.</hi> Their brightneſs and vaſtneſs, whilſt they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our wonder, invite us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Power, and Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Majeſty of their Architect;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42889:27"/>
ſo Holy and Good men declare his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too, for being renewed after his Image in Holineſs and righteouſneſs, they repreſent to the World an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect draught of ſome of the glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> God they worſhip: thus as the power of Miracles imported to the Apoſtles, forc'd the Beholders to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, who had given ſuch gifts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men; ſo too Chriſt exhorts his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>to let their Light ſhine before men, that when they ſee thoſe good works, they may glorifie God, who is in Heaven;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the lovelineſs of that Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs deriv'd from him, as the other were by his power.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is Goodneſs, by which we own a God, and acknowledge him to be ours. Divine worſhip is the confeſſion of our meanneſs and his Majeſty; and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to his Laws is the fulleſt proof we can give of our Allegiance and his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy; and therefore they who live irreligiouſly let 'em pretend to believe and think what they will, are ſaid to be without God in the world, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him in their works.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Holineſs or Goodneſs is really
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42889:28"/>
Divine worſhip, and therefore it is in Scripture defin'd to be Religion, and Wiſdome, and Knowledge. To know God this is Wiſdom, and to depart from evil this is underſtanding <hi>To do Juſtice, to releive the Poor and Needy, is not this to know God,</hi> ſaith the Lord: pure Religion and undefiled is this, to viſit the Fatherleſs and Widows in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and to keep ones ſelf unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the world; more plainly; what is worſhip, but the cleaving to God with purity and earneſtneſs of Affections acting in conformity to his Law as thoſe Affections ſhall invite and inable us? and this is the very ſame thing with Holineſs. So that it is plain, that Holineſs and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs contribute to Gods Glory, the two only wayes we are only capable of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying him, that is by our own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular worſhip, and by the influence our example hath upon others.</p>
                  <p n="2">§ 2. It is moſt ſerviceable to the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Man <hi>here and hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Here.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. All the advantage of peacefu, Governments, friendly Neighborhood I comfortable and cloſer unions, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42889:28"/>
pleaſant Retirements, depend on and ariſe from Goodneſs: But ſuppoſe the World planted with Covetouſneſs inſtead of Juſtice, Pride inſtead of Meekneſs, Cruelty inſtead of Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Revenge and Malice inſtead of Mildneſs and Charity, falſhood and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtead of Conſtancy and Truth, &amp;c. and imagine if you can whether all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties would not be torn into as many Factions as there are croſs intereſts and oppoſite paſſions, whether any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce could be juſt and ſmooth, any tie laſting and delightful, whether it were poſſible to find ſecurity or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure either in a private or a publick Life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is Holineſs which beſt ſecures a mans inward peace, guards and arms him againſt thoſe impreſſions which outward temptations make, preſcribes bounds to our Deſires, ſcatters our Fears, confirms our Hopes, raiſes our Affections to things of true and laſting Excellency; that is, in few words, it not only ſettles our peace by eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the empire of the mind over the inferiour Appetites, but alſo provides for our pleaſure, by filling the mind
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42889:29"/>
with ſpiritual Joyes, and Peace, and Hope.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Goodneſs is wholly neceſſary: 1. To recommend us to the Love of God, whoſe infinite purity, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency cannot approve of any thing that is ſinful and unholy. <hi>This is the Meſſage that we have received of him, that God is Light,</hi> &amp;c. Where you ſee that the Law is founded in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath an intrinſick reſemblance to his own Holineſs; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence he can neither alter it nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with its Obſervation. 2. To qualifie us for Heaven, for it is Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which weans the Soul from all fondneſs for the Body, and the World, and poſſeſſes it with an intenſe Love of God and Holineſs, which two things do firſt capacitate it for that world, wherein God, and holy Spirits dwell, and Secondly recommend it to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter degrees of Glory and Happyneſs in it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all this the Scripture ſpeaks This Doctrine in expreſs terms, the <hi>grace of God which hath appear'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42889:29"/>
all men teacheth us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was the great buſineſs of our Saviours Life, he was ſtill inſtructing men in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Kingdome, that is, Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Righteouſneſs, and Sobriety. His Miracles did confirm the Divinity of his Perſon, and this too was carefully ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, to gain authority to his Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude this Chapter with the abſurdity of the contrary Doctrine. Of what uſe would the Goſpel be in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either to God's Glory, or Mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, if it were onely to be believ'd, and not obeyed! To what purpoſe is light come into the world, if men may ſtill love darkneſs? to what purpoſe did the Son who lay in the boſome of the Father reveal him more gloriouſly to us, if, knowing him as God, it be yet lawful for us not to glorifie him, as ſuch—</p>
                  <p>And as inſignificant would this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion render it to the happineſs of Man; for of what uſe will all the excellent rules of Juſtice, Charity, Meekneſs, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> prove, if we continue peeviſh and revengeful, intemperate and luſtful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to what purpoſe are the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42889:30"/>
fuller diſcoveries of another World, Life and Immortality, and the Belief of Jeſus being the Son of God, if they do not enable us to conquer the world and mortifie the fleſh? and if I walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Laws of the Fleſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate the Laws of the Spirit, can I chooſe but dread a God whom I have wrong'd? and will not <hi>unruly Paſſions</hi> and a <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Conſcience</hi> make a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable as a <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Heathen?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Goodneſs now be the end and drift of the holy belief of Chriſtians, then I infer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>beſt Man</hi> is the beſt Son of the Church, and he whoſe affections are more rais'd and heavenly, and hath leaſt of the mixture of ſenſuality, is of the higheſt form in the School of Chriſt, becauſe he doth beſt anſwer the deſign of his Lord, and walks in ſome meaſure as he walk'd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the moſt infallible chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of a true Faith are to be taken from the <hi>government</hi> of our Paſſions; our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt</hi> o're the world, and the <hi>increaſe</hi> of our inward <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>hope.</hi> Good Lord! how apt are we to put a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42889:30"/>
a cheat upon the World and our ſelves, to perſwade it and our ſelves that we believe, tho there be no change in our Souls and Converſations, and therefore conſequently we do nothing leſs. I ſhall hereafter never think that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve aright, till I have a <hi>Love</hi> for all his <hi>Commandments,</hi> till I can <hi>meditate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully, pray vigorouſly, relie conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, obey readily, ſuffer patiently, rejoyce humbly, expect reverently,</hi> and (happy is me, if I attain that height) earneſtly too, the hour of my death, or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of my Lord. I ſhall never hereafter think, that I have ſtudied or known divine truth to any purpoſe, till the Truth hath made me free, reſcued me from the bondage of Sin, and fears of Death.</p>

                  <p>There are two other Inducements to a retir'd Private Life, The one found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a vice, the other in a miſtake.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Firſt is when Men withdraw from the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> as from the <hi>trouble</hi> of the World, and their <hi>Pleaſure</hi> not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is their firſt and chief motive.

and they would withdraw to enjoy themſelves; and this is unchriſtian and unmanly, 'tis <hi>Epicuriſm,</hi> not <hi>Contempt</hi> of the World,</p>

That the Buſie and Active Life is the more <hi>Excellent;</hi> and the more <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</hi> 1. the more excellent, as being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of hazards, and troubles, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; there is a larger field for vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, for Patience, Courage, Meekneſs, Reliance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in an active than ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative life, and ſuch will receive more Crowns. And when I conſider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and neceſſities of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42889:32"/>
I cannot but think acts of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as prevalent to the wiping off our guilt, as the ſevereſt penances. A vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and active life ſpent in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the welfare of others, is a more perfect inſtance of ſelf denial, ſpeaks a greater contradiction to our eaſe and pleaſure, commits more violence upon our inclinations, than any acts of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Auſterity can pretend to do; for beſides the Pains, the watching, and the faſting incident to both a like, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Contrivance, the induſtry of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, the uneaſineſs of refuſals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſufficiently weigh down the one ſide. Beſides this Confinement impriſons our light under a buſhel; it is a Cover, a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin for our Talents to conceal them and render them uſeleſs to others; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our reward will be leſs in another world, and our graces the fainter in this, <hi>For to him what hath,</hi> i. e. <hi>uſeth, ſhall be given,</hi> Grace like the Widows Oile increaſes by being charitably imparted: That Flame which warms my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, reflects back with a double heat upon my ſelf, and that Goodneſs which cheriſhes <hi>his</hi> heart, ſoftens and ſanctifies
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42889:33"/>
my own. And over and above all this, I enjoy a ſtrange delight in doing good, and in beholding the fruits which my own hands have planted. And my aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the confidence of my hopes encreaſes by the conſcience of that Love, which my works convince me I have for my Brethren.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That a buſie imployment of our ſelves for the advantage of others, is of more abſolute neceſſity. The world is one intire Body, and each member muſt be ſerviceable in its place, nor can any part withdraw it ſelf from the whole at its pleaſure, hence it is that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Law of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour are Rules of Society, of Juſtice, Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he himſelf, the beſt example, made his Retirements by night, but by day <hi>he went about doing good;</hi> Nature hath founded a cognati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt us, as we pertake of the ſame form, ſhape, reaſon. But the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion hath cemented us in clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer unions, made us the Members of the ſame Body, tied us together by faith and love, by the ſame Sacraments, the ſame Promiſes, and the ſame hopes:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42889:33"/>
and therefore we cannot in reaſon think we do one another all the good we are bound to, by a meer abſtinence from doing wrong, and by ſequeſtring our ſelves from the ſervice and concerns of our Brethren.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Glory of God is more concern'd in the deportment of whole Societies, than a few private perſons, as much as the ſafety of a multitude is more valuable than that of a very few, and goodneſs redounds more to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour when publique and almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, than when cloyſtered up in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes of a few: therefore all good men muſt needs be obliged to promote the intereſts of Holineſs and goodneſs in the publique, becauſe the Divine Glory is ſo deeply concern'd in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. (Which ought well to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,) The nature of Goodneſs is ſuch that it cannot well be conceiv'd how <hi>the being good</hi> is ſeparable from <hi>doing good.</hi> God tho his own Heaven and Happineſs, did yet found a World, to which he might be an univerſal Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; his Goodneſs was certainly the moſt powerful motive to his Creation,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42889:34"/>
not any conſiderable acceſſion that his happineſs was to receive from it. This Goodneſs therefore in Man ought to be a Vigorous and Active Principle, and render 'em the Benefactors of Mankind. It is indeed hardly conceivable, how men ſhould be zealous Patrons of virtue and goodneſs, and yet not concern'd to protect and own them, to promote and incourage 'em in the world; or how men can be inflam'd with a very ſtrong Love of God, and yet not indeavour to eſtabliſh a true ſenſe of his Beauties and excellencies in the minds of Men; or how, laſtly, any can be poſſeſs'd with a paſſionate kindneſs for a Brother, and yet never mingle with the concerns of his Soul or Body.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The great motives of the Goſpel are, The example of our Lord and Saviour, whoſe Diſciples we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ourſelves, whom we are bound to imitate; and he went about doing good. The glorious rewards annex'd to all thoſe who any wayes benefit Mankind, either by inſtructing the mind, or relieving the body; The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Children of God at the laſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42889:34"/>
Judgement is compos'd wholly of Acts of Charity, all which ſuppoſe an active life. Conformable to this Doctrine is that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15, 16. <hi>By him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us offer the ſacrifice of Praiſe to God continually, that is the fruit of our Lips, giving thanks to his Name. But to do good and to communicate forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;</hi> we muſt pray, but prayer without <hi>doing good</hi> is an unpleaſing ſacrifice, without Charity our very Devotion is unchriſtian, and our Religion unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
                  <p>This let thoſe mind, who are long in their Prayers, ſevere in their outward deportment, frequent hearers of the Word, and yet we can diſcern in them no fruits of Meekneſs or Charity: let 'em conſider whether they do not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the nature of Religion, whether they do not chooſe the more eaſie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, becauſe it coſts them nothing, whether they have not a ſecret reſerve of Covetouſneſs or Frowardneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having ſpoke this much of the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of doing good, and the Motives to it, I'le propoſe three or four Rules,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42889:35"/>
and ſubmit 'em to your Conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we muſt judge of our call to do good by the capacities and fitneſſes with which God hath endow'd us; and here I cannot but proclaim our own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious priviledge, That tho to do good be ſo great and glorious a thing, that it is a kind of imitation of God himſelf, a thing our bleſſed Saviour came down on earth for, yet it hath pleas'd God ſo to multiply the inſtances and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of goodneſs, that there is none ſo unfortunate, as to be uncapable of doing good. The happy by their wealth, the wiſe by their knowledge, even the miſerable themſelves, may by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and courage, and prayer, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and relieve the world; and we are to judge by our Parts and Fortunes the way that God hath mark'd out for our Charity and be content to obey him in his own methods.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let Meditation and Prayer admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to our good actions, and like oil to a Lamp, give our Charity freſh Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Flame; for as private Religion is deficient without publique Charity; ſo Charity, unleſs often refreſh'd by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42889:35"/>
Devotion, and Heavenly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, will cool and languiſh; our Hearts will be tough and inſenſible, and our doing good will be onely the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Cuſtome or Prudence, or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Spirit, not of Religion or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and if (which is the beſt can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd) the man conſecrates the whole Maſs of his Actions by purity of inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and continues an obſtinate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of Prayer, as far as he thinks ſtrict duty obliges him to, yet for want of more leaſurely Meditation, and more ſerious Reflexions, his addreſſes will loſe their warmth, his Soul will abate much of its Love, and whilſt his Religion loſes ſo much of its pleaſure and ſweetneſs, what wonder if his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity reliſh more of drudgery than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
                  <p n="3">3: That we may not be diſcourag'd from doing good, by any difficulty or misfortune which may attend us in it, in our nightly Reflexions, let us judge not the hapineſs of our ſucceſs, but the integrity of our endeavour; and let us think it ſufficient reward, that we have obeyed God; or if we will meaſure our
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42889:36"/>
ſucceſs let us examine how much our experience hath improv'd our Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, our Patience, our Reliance, or Charity, for ſcarce any action, but will exerciſe ſome of theſe graces.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Look upon doing good as truely your Buſineſs, as Prayer or Hearing the Word or Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore never think your time miſpent, which is laid out in viſiting the impriſon'd or ſick, relieving the neceſſitous, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the afflicted, and reducing thoſe that erre into the paths of Sobriety and Truth, tho this time be par'd off from our Meditations, Prayer, and Sacrament. He is a good man indeed, who prefers meek attendance and miniſtry, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate addreſſes to the Souls of men before much knowledge, paſſionate diſputes and high pretences.</p>
                  <p>O Charity, how lovely muſt thou needs be in the eye of Heaven, for wert thou planted in all our hearts, Earth would reſemble that place above: I will be pleaſed therefore with my ſelf only in proportion to what I ſhare of thee, for I know this is the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard by which God now value me,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42889:36"/>
and will hereafter judge me.</p>
                  <p>If this be the end of Religion, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to implant goodneſs and charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, to make us holy and like God, and kind, and beneficial, one to another what is it, that the World hates it for; I may ſay, concerning thoſe who perſecute Chriſtianity, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did of thoſe who Crucified its Author. <hi>I wot that through ignorance ye did it,</hi> Act. 3 17. Surely it is becauſe you do not diſcern its beauty, that you do not Love it.</p>
                  <p>If any retir'd life promote the end I have mention'd, as well as an Active, once I would not be thought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it.</p>

                  <p>When I read the glorious Achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of a true Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>That it ſubdued Kingdomes, wrought Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, obtained promiſes.</hi> &amp;c. and in one word, ſupported men under the <hi>greateſt miſeries,</hi> and arm'd them againſt the moſt <hi>taking pleaſures</hi> of this World; I cannot ſufficiently wonder, that a fuller and clearer diſcovery of a Heaven, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to us by the ſtrongeſt evidences, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power,</hi> ſhould have ſo weak an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon us Chriſtians; we take no more pains for Heaven, than if we did not believe there were ſuch a place, and we have the ſame <hi>cares</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the things preſent, which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Infidels have; ſo that tho' we talk much of Faith we make little or no uſe at all of it;</p>
                  <p>Therefore, leaſt any man delude and fool himſelf with a perſwaſion of being endowed with that Faith which he hath
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42889:38"/>
not, I'le give ſuch an account of it as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the Goſpel of the Kingdom, as ſuits with, and ſerves the <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mankind,</hi> and the <hi>end and Aims of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Faith, ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of things not ſeen;</hi> the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or preſence, <hi>the evidence or Proof,</hi> 'tis not a ſlight tranſient glance, drowſie imperfect aſſent, a ſtaggering wavering opinion, but 'tis a lively repreſentation, an affective viſion, a full perſwaſion of the glorious truths of the Goſpel: when the Objects are ſo fully and clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they not onely <hi>convince,</hi> but, <hi>take</hi> us too; it is having the mind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightn'd, and ſo looking upon things with the eys of Angels, and judging by the light of the bleſſed Spirit,</p>
                  <p>It is not only to ſee that the things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible <hi>are,</hi> but to ſee them in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>ſuch</hi> as they are. Eternity as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and Heaven as Heaven, that is, a ſtate of truely great, and glorious hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; on this account, the things <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> may have a different face and aſpect, when regarded by the eyes of <hi>Faith,</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:42889:38"/>
and when of <hi>Senſe;</hi> for ſenſe ſtops in the things themſelves, and regards their uſefulneſs to the pleaſure or profit of this preſent life; but Faith carries its ſight forward, and compares the things which are <hi>ſeen,</hi> with thoſe <hi>hoped</hi> for, the things temporal, with thoſe eternal, and then all below appears but meer vanity.</p>
                  <p>This whole account of Faith we may find in the 13 <hi>verſe</hi> of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Theſe all died in Faith,</hi> (and what it is to dye or live <hi>in Faith,</hi> the following words explain,) <hi>not having reciev'd the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, (i.e.</hi> the accompliſhment of them) <hi>but having ſeen them a far off, (i. e.</hi> by divine Revelation) <hi>were perſwaded of them, and embraced them,</hi> (and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequence of this was,) <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth:</hi> Now Faith is unalterable as to its eſſence, but its objects may vary, they may be more or fewer, clearer or darker, according to the Nature of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. its evidence may be fuller or weaker, but ſtill it muſt be ſuch as may ſuffice to convince man of the Divine authority of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</p>

                  <p>By Faith I ſee that God, who is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, who tho he dwels in Heaven, doth yet humble himſelf to behold all that is done upon Earth; nor doth he only <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> but <hi>govern</hi> all things too: And whilſt I contemplate his <hi>Wiſedom, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Truth, Goodneſs, Holineſs, Juſtice,</hi> &amp;c. manifeſted to me in the Goſpel, I adore and worſhip him, I love and fear him, I call on and relie upon him, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to walk before him and be perfect; I know nothing like him, and therefore I deſire nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide him, or equal to him in Heaven or in Earth.</p>

Righteouſneſs and holineſs in the world; I trace him thorough all the Stages of his ſufferings, and travel till I behold him faſten'd to the Croſs, and bleeding out his meek and holy Soul at thoſe painful wounds the nails had made; and all this for my ſins, and <hi>the ſins of the whole World;</hi> and then with what a ſtrange mixture of Paſſions that ſight fills me! with grief and ſhame, and yet with love and hope too: How I am amaz'd to ſee what <hi>indignation</hi> a holy God hath diſcover'd againſt <hi>Sin!</hi> and how my heart bleeds to think that my ſins have treated thus deſpitefully and cruelly my dear Lord and Maſter! and with what a melting paſſion, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſolutions of a fervent induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervice, and an everlaſting zeal and devotion, do I behold the amazing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of my Saviours Love, whilſt with ſo much affection and ſweetneſs he <hi>laid down his life for me,</hi> whilſt his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy and his perſecutor!

                  <p>As for Earth, I am ſo far from admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, I value it not; I know <hi>I</hi> muſt <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ here</hi> a while, and therefore I muſt be <hi>fed</hi> and <hi>cloath'd,</hi> but <hi>my heavenly Father knows I have need of theſe things,</hi>

and his is the Earth, and the fulneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and therefore he cannot want means and ability to provide for me; and he is a wiſe and a good God, and he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd by his Son to take care of me, and all this will invite him to deſign and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what is beſt for me: Upon theſe grounds I think <hi>I</hi> could hope (like <hi>Abraham</hi>) even againſt hope, <hi>I</hi> could relie upon God without any flattering appearances of promiſes, Friends nay or any viſible probabilities; <hi>I</hi> am <hi>to ſeek the righteouſneſs</hi> of the Kingdome, and permit the Government of the World to the God of it; I am his child and <hi>he</hi> is my Heavenly Father, <hi>to obey</hi> is <hi>my</hi> Duty, and (with Reverence be it ſaid) to <hi>provide</hi> for me is his.</p>
                  <p>By this time it is eaſie to be diſcern'd what kind of Faith it is muſt ſave or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us; one that enlightens our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and raviſheth our Heart; one that prayes and watches, that contends and ſtruggles, and fights and conquers; one that makes us too great for Earth, and fit for Heaven; one that fears, and loves, and worſhips, and ſeeks, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and hopes: And then</p>

reflection upon my life each evening, my conſcience acquit me as a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror through Faith and Love, then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory: what a beautiful morning doth this Faith ſhed upon any ſoul! How I long that thy Kingdome, O God, may come! And how I diſdain all that this vain World can flatter me with! Then like <hi>Peter, tho all men ſhould be offended (fall through temptation)</hi> yet will not I. Give me a temptation equal to this Faith. (till the ſenſe of my frailty, as in <hi>Peter,</hi> do <hi>lower</hi> my confidence and yet <hi>heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> my reſolutions.)</p>
                  <p>And yet all this doth not in the leaſt imply any reliance or confidence in my <hi>own Righteouſneſs</hi> or <hi>works</hi> (phraſes of the ſame ſenſe in Scripture.) But that I know Repentance and Faith are propos'd as the ſole conditions of Juſtification tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the bloud of Chriſt. And that theſe fruits or effects of Righteouſneſs (I mean a holy life) are the onely evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of theſe habits; and therefore I can never perſwade my ſelf that I <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>repent,</hi> till I <hi>live well;</hi> nor ever flatter my ſelf with Peace, Peace <hi>through
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42889:42"/>
his bloud,</hi> till I thus <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>Repent;</hi> to do otherwiſe is preſumption not Faith; 'tis the fond and groundleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of fooliſh Virgins, which ſhall be for ever ſhut out from the Bridegrooms preſence.</p>
                  <p>There is not in the book of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one plainer Doctrine than this. Not every one that ſaith unto me <hi>Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he that doth the will of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven:</hi> which is, not every one that profeſſes me to be Lord, and ſo far relies upon me as to knock at the gates of Heaven with preſumption of admiſſion, ſhall enter, <hi>&amp;c. If we walk in the light as he</hi> (God) <hi>is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another</hi> (and truely our fellowſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 3.) <hi>and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> Where, walking in the light (that is Holineſs) is ſuppos'd as a neceſſary condition to our purification by the blood of Chriſt; and, <hi>tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worketh patience, and patience experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and <hi>experience hope,</hi> and <hi>hope mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not aſham'd,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the ſteps
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42889:42"/>
or ſtages by which the Chriſtian maketh his progreſs into aſſurance. Tribulation being conquer'd worketh patience, and Patience experience <hi>i.e.</hi> a conviction or proof of our Love of God, and this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience worketh hope, which contains in it th' aſſurance of pardon, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance of a better world; and by the ſame method doth he who is attack'd by the temptations of pleaſures proceed to a particular aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>The Sum of all is this; man may be conſider'd in Three ſtates. 1. <hi>Of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneration,</hi> and then he is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the truth of the Goſpel, (if that be ſuppos'd) this belief will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of his unrighteouſneſs, and ſhew him the wrath of God reveal'd from Heaven againſt all ungodly and impenitent ſinners, and on the other hand, the blood of Chriſt (who became a propiation for the ſins of the World) will encourage him to hope for reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and pardon, if he repent and relye upon Chriſt; And it will high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, oblige him to both; or 2. In a <hi>ſtate of Regeneration,</hi> and then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that experience and proof a man
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42889:43"/>
hath of the truth and ſincerity of his Converſion, ſuch is the proportion and degree of his aſſurance and hopes; which doth not exclude but ſuppoſe Faith in Chriſt; for this is no more then to believe, that now his ſins are pardon'd, his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers heard, his ſervices accepted, and he ſhall at laſt bere warded, (if he perſevere unto the end) in and thorough Chriſt. Or 3. In a ſtate of <hi>Relapſe,</hi> and even here, he hath yet hopes, (if he repent) tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the blood of Chriſt. For this is frequently aſſerted in Scripture. I'le urge but one place. 1. <hi>Jo</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>My little Children,</hi> (regenerate certainly) <hi>Theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not; and if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Righteous, <hi>and he is the propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our ſins, &amp;c.</hi> that by theſe ſins are not underſtood the <hi>unavoidable frailties and imperfections</hi> of the beſt men, but plain and manifeſt tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Law, is plain. 1. From hence, that this is the general notion of ſin in this Epiſtle. 2. from the manner of ſpeaking, <hi>that ye ſin not, if any man ſin,</hi> which cannot be ſenſe if applied to the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42889:43"/>
unavoidable errours and imperfections of the beſt of men. 3. They are here ſaid to be of the number of thoſe ſins for which Chriſt ſhed his blood, and are equall'd with the ſins of the reſt of the World.</p>
                  <p>And beſides theſe Three uſes of Faith I know none, nor what more can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to, or deſir'd from the blood of Chriſt; I cannot ſee, unleſs men will wilfully abuſe their Faith into an impunity and patronage for ſin; or what diſparagement it can reflect upon this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt, That it obligeth us to Holineſs, and reſcues us from the power as well as guilt of ſin, I am not able to comprehend; as to the ſilly ſcandal <hi>of truſting in works,</hi> they that know what theſe words or terms <hi>(Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by works, and juſtified by Repentance, and Faith)</hi> mean, know that the one implies a perfect contradiction to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the former denyes any ſin or iniquity, and the latter doth directly ſuppoſe it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Without <hi>ſome degrees</hi> of Faith, it is impoſſible that a <hi>wicked</hi> man ſhould be awaken'd into any ſerious ſence of his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42889:44"/>
condition, or ſhould be induc'd to ſet himſelf in good earneſt to pleaſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God; without a <hi>good meaſure</hi> of this Faith, the very <hi>regenerate</hi> will never be able to conquer the World, and ſubdue the fleſh, and enter into their reſt, I mean with th' Apoſtle <hi>a Reſt from ſin,</hi> for their <hi>endeavours</hi> will be but weak and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing; their <hi>prayers</hi> cold and faint; the <hi>Acts and instances</hi> of Religion will be undertaken as a Duty of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> not <hi>delight;</hi> the whole <hi>Progreſs</hi> of their Chriſtian warfare, will, like the driving of Pharoahs Charriots when the Wheels were off, beſlow and uneaſie; they will be liable to <hi>frequent relapſes:</hi> their <hi>Life</hi> will not be a firm Peace, but an <hi>unſtedy truce</hi> with conſcience: and their <hi>Death</hi> will be mixt and checker'd with jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Diſtruſts, and faint hopes, like a ſky ſpotted with numerous Clouds:</p>
                  <p>But if we arrive at a good degree of this precious Faith, we ſhall be more than Conquerors o're the <hi>World</hi> and <hi>ourſelves;</hi> we ſhall be plac'd above the Reach of Temptations, preſerv'd tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the power of Faith unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: we ſhall be too great to be ſwoln
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42889:44"/>
with vanity in <hi>proſperity,</hi> or to be caſt down in affliction; we ſhall find all the wayes of wiſedome wayes of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and all her paths peace: in one word, we ſhall rejoyce always with joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, and when our glaſs is run, and our Lives ſpent, we ſhall be tranſlated to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Seats of Perfection and Peace.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For the obtaining, and improving, and confirming of this holy Faith, it is neceſſary, that our Religion be not meer Credulity or Cuſtome, but that we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly weigh thoſe two great witneſſes our Saviour appeals to, for the proof of his coming from God, his <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Doctrine;</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of the one, and <hi>Holineſs</hi> of the other, being ſufficient evidences of his Commiſſion from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: To which we muſt add the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies God</hi> himſelf gave him from Heaven, his <hi>reſurrection</hi> from the Dead and <hi>aſcention</hi> into glory; and all thoſe <hi>mighty works</hi> perform'd by his <hi>followers</hi> in the virtue of Faith in his name; and to be firmly rooted and grounded in Faith through theſe arguments, is that which St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts Chriſtians to,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42889:45"/>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. <hi>To be ready alwayes to give an anſwer to every man that asks you a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the hope that is in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By frequent retirements and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolemn and devout Meditation, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint our ſelves as intimately as we can with the glorious Truths of the Goſpel of Chriſt, to draw the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of them as lovely as may be; and to dwell and gaze on the things we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, till the light of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath ſhed it ſelf thorough the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Soul, warm'd all our paſſions, and the <hi>Body</hi> it ſelf ſeem to reliſh and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of the <hi>mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt uſeful matter of our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations will be 1. The Nature of the the God we worſhip, I mean the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Attributes Mankind is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in, His Truth and Wiſedom, his Power and his Goodneſs: And 2.

                  <p>Love is not a meet <hi>Approbation</hi> of the underſtanding, but alſo an <hi>affection</hi> of the Will, (or Heart in Scripture phraſe) And therefore <hi>Coldneſs</hi> and <hi>Indifferency</hi> in Religion, and <hi>warmth,</hi> and paſſion for the world, cannot be juſtified by bearing our ſelves in hand, that we do nevertheleſs <hi>Love</hi> God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do <hi>prefer</hi> him in our thoughts above all things, and becauſe we will not do what will <hi>diſpleaſe</hi> him; for the former of theſe may be an unavoidable conſequence of a clear underſtanding, and the latter of an innate <hi>Self-love,</hi> which may be able to reſtrain us from the Commiſſion of thoſe ſins, which we believe will do us an unſpeakable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
                  <p>Theſe do well in their place, and are preſuppos'd to the love of God, for no man can love God unleſs he <hi>know</hi> him; nor will any man make any diſtinction of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil (i. e.</hi> lovely or hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by conſequence) unleſs he love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42889:46"/>
but yet theſe are apparently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable from, and can ſtand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately and alone without the love of God; and therefore let none deceive themſelves, for <hi>To love the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all our Soul, and with all our ſtrength, and with all our mind</hi> is ſomething more, than to entertain an honourable <hi>opinion</hi> of him, or to avoid affronting him, becauſe he is able to puniſh us; the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes this love by <hi>Delight and Joy,</hi> by <hi>Deſire and Longing; Hungring, Thirſting, Seeking,</hi> and the like; and more fully; if we love God above all things, our hearts will be where our Treaſure is; our affections will be faſten'd on things above; and our Converſation will be in Heaven, becauſe our God is there;</p>
                  <p>Now we cannot converſe with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope, Meditation</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore it muſt follow, that they who love God muſt be induſtrious to improve theſe Graces, and be frequent in the exerciſe of theſe Duties, as the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of enjoyment: And</p>

and thirſt after Righteouſneſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which beautifies the Souls, and renders us like God, and therefore ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his eyes; and we ſhall delight in all thoſe good and virtuous actions, which are the proofs of an inflam'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and indear us to God, he that loves him keeps his Commandments: and we ſhall hate nothing ſo mortally as ſin, becauſe it ſtains and ſullies the beauty of our Souls, diſtaſtes the God we love, and interrupts our peace and joy, and extinguiſhes our hopes; and, if this be the frame and habit of our Souls towards God, then becauſe we cannot love or ſerve two ſuch contrary Maſters, as God and the World, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe temporal things which are ſeen, will appear very cheap and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to us, and our concern for them will be ſo cold and indifferent that no change which betides them, no imaginary excellency that is in them, will be able to raiſe our Paſſions to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract our thoughts, to abate our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to divide our affections, and overthrow our Faith; for the love of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42889:47"/>
God, the proſpect of a more glorious life will have diſarm'd the Glory, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Wealth of this World of all their Charm and Temptation; and if ſo how can we then be led captive by what we do not in the leaſt admire? How can we be afflicted at the loſs of what we do not value? or, Why can we not be calmly divided from what our affections have renounc'd alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</p>
                  <p>Vain World adieu! I am above ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy <hi>Menaces</hi> or <hi>Flatteries:</hi> I fear nothing, becauſe I am at peace with the God I love; and <hi>I deſpiſe</hi> thy guilded dreams, becauſe the love of my God ſwallows up all my deſires, and I am content to have no portion but him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: How my Heart pants after thy Courts, O God, the Holy of Holies, the Heaven of Heavens, where I ſhall for ever behold thy face, and Reign in the Kingdom of my bleſſed Saviour for ever and ever! Now with St. <hi>Paul, I long to be ſet at liberty, to be diſſolved from this body, and to be with Chriſt,</hi> nor ſhould I willingly ſtay longer here on Earth, but in <hi>Obedience</hi> to thy holy Will, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign

of ſpending this life in <hi>doing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> to thy glory, and in expreſſions of my love, in <hi>Longings,</hi> and <hi>Watchings,</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> &amp;c. And when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>this,</hi> merhinks my Life's too ſhort, and I ſhall go to Heaven too ſoon, and <hi>I</hi> could wiſh my Sun would ſtand ſtill a little that I might <hi>do</hi> and <hi>ſuffer</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for my Lord before I go to enter into his joy, and to receive a Crown.</p>
                  <p>It is true theſe are heights of Love, which all do not, tho it were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all could attain to, for we have need of ſanctified paſſions to enable us to do our duty with delight and vigour; But none are from the want of ſuch degrees <hi>of Ardour</hi> to conclude themſelves, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly void of the Love of God, or deſerted by him; for God is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely above our conceptions, and that of him, which we do conceive, as <hi>Power, Wiſedom,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> tho amiable, yet are ſpiritual, and not the objects of ſenſe, and therefore do not move us with the ſame violence that ſenſible things do, whence it is eaſie to conclude, that our love of God is of a different nature from <hi>that</hi> we pay
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42889:48"/>
the creature, 'tis a more ſpiritual affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction mixt with Adoration, 'tis an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſire of pleaſing and enjoying him, not alwayes terminating in ſo vehement and <hi>ſenſible</hi> a paſſion as viſible objects beget in us; and therefore the ſafeſt way is to judge of our ſtate not by <hi>tranſports,</hi> but by the <hi>firmneſs of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,</hi> and by the <hi>conſtancy</hi> and <hi>cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of our <hi>Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe as there is a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar preſence of God (as I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive evident by Scripture) ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, there may be a withdrawing and retirement of that preſence; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when I find my underſtanding dim and clouded, or diſtracted and ſhaken with ſuggeſtions to unbelief, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires lukewarm and groveling, my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion faint and drowſie, and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion without guſt and reliſh, <hi>I</hi> am weary of my ſelf, and I have no reſt by reaſon of thy abſence, O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord. Then firſt I lay before me my Life and review my Actions, which are late and freſh in memory ſince this ill temper hath ſeiz'd me, and examine what it is hath diſpleas'd my God, and if I
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42889:49"/>
find the accurſed thing that drove away a holy God, I caſt my ſelf down before him, and abhor and renounce it: But ſecondly, if ſin do not appear to me to be the cauſe of this indiſpoſition and liſtleſsneſs, then perhaps I have not been as watchful and induſtrious to improve my Graces as I ſhould; or if this be not it, perhaps 'tis but an <hi>alteration in my body</hi> that clogs and benights this Soul, and then I groan at the miſeries of my Pilgrimage, and bemoan the infelicities of my Nature; but if none of theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the cauſe, Then thirdly, I reſt humbly patient, waiting till God pleaſe to return to his reſting place: it were Pride and Sawcineſs in me to expect my Heaven here; to be impatient, unleſs I live alwayes in extaſies caus'd by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pretence: I will meekly ſet my ſelf to my duty, and ſubmit to his bleſſed Will, whether he think fit to Crown my Cup with over-flowing joy, and to reward my labour by inward tranſports or not.</p>
                  <p>And is it not fit, I ſhould thus Love my God; whatever there be which can take and endear a rational and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42889:49"/>
ſpirit is to be found in him: all the notions I can poſſibly frame to my ſelf of a <hi>ſpiritual perfection and Beauty,</hi> I conceive, united in him; Goodneſs, Wiſdome, Power, Truth, Conſtancy, are the Characters by which the Goſpel diſcovers him to us, and theſe have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable charms upon all ingenious minds, and they are intelligible enough to any that will conſider them; it is true he is a ſpirit, and ſo, incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to us in his eſſence and therefore I cannot frame to my ſelf an Image for my Love as one friend doth of another, but the time will come when I ſhall be ſpiritual enough to ſee him as I am ſeen, and then my delight and Love will be proportionable in ſome meaſure to his beauty and perfection; in the mean time, my Reaſon as well as the Goſpel aſſures me that he is infinitely aimable tho that beauty be now a <hi>Light that is inacceſſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beſides this, that great Character of <hi>Love and Mercy,</hi> (manifeſted in its moſt excellent luſtre in the Goſpel) is enough to endear him to us; He is not now our Father only upon the account,

                     <p>O <hi>Glorious God, it is the ſole excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of my Nature, that I am capable of loving thee; and it is my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious priviledge, that thou art pleas'd to ſuffer and admit of the addreſſes of my Soul; in this only I am a kin to Angels. In thoſe talents which ſerve only to the end of a corporal life, I am out done by Brutes: O therefore give me grace to dwel as often as I can in the divine contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy nature, to look forward to that glory which thy bounty hath reveal'd and promis'd me; to conſider by what methods of infinite Love thou doſt prepare me for it; and let all this make me love thee above all things, and deſire to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Thee my Heavenly Father, and Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified,</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Second part of Charity is the <hi>Love of our Neighbour,</hi> of which now.</p>
                     <p>Charity is in ſhort, the Love of our Brethren, or a kind of Brotherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42889:51"/>
one towards another; the Rule and Standard by which we are to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and regulate this Habit, is, that love we bear <hi>Ourſelves,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> bore us, that is, that it be <hi>unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conſtant,</hi> and out of no other <hi>deſign</hi> but their happyneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. taking Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in a moſt comprehenſive ſenſe, as it animates all other graces, and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all our actions, which relate to our Neighbour; doth thus divinely deſcribe it. <hi>Charity ſuffereth long and is kind: Charity envieth not: Charity vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not her own, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoyceth not in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> (or wrong) <hi>but rejoyceth in the truth</hi> (faithfulneſs or fair dealing) <hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things</hi> (or rather covereth or concealeth, <hi>i. e.</hi> others Error) <hi>believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now to reduce all to fewer heads, and to conſider Charity in a cloſſer ſenſe, it contains two things. 1. <hi>The doing good to,</hi> and 2. <hi>Forgiving one another.</hi>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:42889:51"/>
The things which are capable of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any benefit by our Charity are our Neighbours Reputation, Body, Soul, and therefore,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Charity ſecures mans credit, by denouncing a Hell to the <hi>Slanderer,</hi> and <hi>Whiſperer,</hi> and <hi>Evil ſpeaker,</hi> &amp;c. This Charity obligeth us not to give way to weak ſurmiſes, but to be forward to believe the beſt, in favour and excuſe of an Error, not to proclaim anothers faults though true and real, unleſs the diſcovery may ſerve a better end than the concealment; which is, <hi>that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt no evil, beareth all things, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth all things</hi> in the Apoſtle; and if it forbid theſe ſins, much more thoſe blacker of open Slanders and private whiſpers.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth this Charity oblige us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to wrong our Neighbours cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, but as far as we can, not to <hi>ſuffer</hi> it to be wrong'd; to protect and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly reſcue their Reputations from the jaws of the Perſecutor, to awe and check the Slanderer by the Majeſty of an holy Anger into ſhame and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for otherwiſe we become acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42889:52"/>
to thoſe ſlanders we entertain and give ear to;</p>
                     <p>If we conſider that to blaſt a mans Reputation, is to render him the <hi>Scorn</hi> and <hi>Hate</hi> of others, and a <hi>Burden</hi> to himſelf, it cannot be that we ſhould be willing to heap ſuch killing miſchiefs upon the Head of one we <hi>Love,</hi> and Charity is ſuppos'd to love <hi>all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Charity miniſters to the Body of our Neighbour; if we will act like men poſſeſs'd by that Charity which ſuits with the Spirit of the Goſpel; our <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Hands</hi> muſt be alwayes open to our Brothers neceſſities, our Souls muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do good and to be kind; And if we are not able to redreſs their griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, or relieve their preſſures by our wealth or intereſt, we muſt eaſe them by our compaſſion, comfort 'em by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advice, and ſuccour them by our Prayers'</p>
                     <p>All that profeſs Chriſtianity, believe this a Duty, and yet how great and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous are the ſufferings of the needy and diſtreſſed, and more great and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous are the luxuries, and the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſes of the Rich; but it happens
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42889:52"/>
thus all acknowledge the duty but ſhift it off by two pretences. 1. <hi>Their own inability.</hi> 2. <hi>The demerit, or unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the needy perſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In anſwer to the firſt pretence, it muſt be confeſs'd; that it is not only <hi>Lawful,</hi> but <hi>our duty</hi> to make proviſion, firſt, for our ſelves and thoſe who are more nearly related to us, but then. 1. The meaſure of this proviſion muſt be our <hi>neceſſities</hi> not wantonneſs; for, if we refuſe relief to the poor on this pretence that we cannot ſupport our vanity, and gaiety, and their poverty together, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly we ſhall periſh under the guilt of <hi>uncharitableneſs.</hi> 2. The preſent time, not the vain fears of the future muſt determine this neceſſity, for if we deny an alms out of our preſent plenty upon an idle fear of future want, it is ſo far from being a juſt excuſe, that it is a double crime, <hi>diſtruſt</hi> in God, as well as <hi>hard heartedneſs</hi> to our Brother, contradictory to <hi>Faith,</hi> as well as <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will anſwer to the Second pretence by degrees: and therefore, 1. Suppoſe the worth or worthleſneſs, or whats
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42889:53"/>
more, unworthineſs of the diſtreſs'd perſon, be only <hi>doubtful and ſuſpected,</hi> then certainly it is not agreeable to Charity, to give up a Brother to ruine, upon a vain ſurmiſe; we are not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their <hi>deſerts,</hi> but to regard their <hi>wants,</hi> I'me ſure this is the <hi>ſafeſt</hi> ſide, Charity may be <hi>miſtaken,</hi> but ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be <hi>unrewarded,</hi> we are herein, (I think) to imitate that Wiſdome and Goodneſs which diſpenſes th' Alms of our Heavenly Father; he hath, no doubt on't, particular favours as well as a particular kindneſs for the good and holy, but as he is the God of all, ſo thoſe his benefits, which all ſtand in abſolute need of, are common to all: but 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the diſtreſs'd perſon be really as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> as <hi>Needy,</hi> unleſs I am ſure that my Charity will feed his vices; I cannot tell tho' God hath pleas'd to paſs a ſentence of affliction upon him, whether he hath appointed me to be the Executioner of it, by withholding that aid which may reprieve his life; how know I but that in thoſe moments I lend him, he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to himſelf and to his God, nay, more whether my Charity may not
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42889:53"/>
be a motive to reduce him; and happy I, if I may ſo cheaply beſtow a double life of body and of ſoul, if I may ſo eaſily retrieve a ſoul my Saviour died for, and whilſt I give an alms, in ſome ſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a Heaven too!</p>
                     <p>But if thoſe I relieve ſhould be the Children of my Father, the fellow heirs of Salvation, how happy an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is light into my hands of obliging thoſe who are ſo dear to Heaven, whoſe intereſt is ſo powerful with the God I worſhip! Yet,</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, in general, whatever the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be, whatever the perſons; bleſt be the hour wherein I have an opportunity to evidence my <hi>Love to God,</hi> and to part with ſomething for the <hi>ſake</hi> of my dear <hi>Saviour!</hi> Bleſt be the hour, wherein I can lay out, the very ſuperfluities of my trifling ſtock, for a Manſion in Heaven, for an abode in everlaſting bliſs; where in I can honeſtly buy the Prayers of the poor, <hi>i. e.</hi> it may be the interceſſion of the bleſſed ſpirit for me; however, they are prayers which are very ſeldome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, for if God hears, when they <hi>curſe</hi> in bitterneſs of Spirit, (when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42889:54"/>
'tis his goodneſs, not their piety, which makes their Prayers heard,) how much more ſhall his goodneſs invite him to hear, when they <hi>bleſs,</hi> in the cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and refreſhment of their ſoul. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how comfortable will my reflexions on my Charity be at the hour of Death, and in the day of Judgement, for (be it with an humble reverence ſpoken, tho in imitation of my Saviour) how will, <hi>that Jeſus whom I have fed, when hungry, cloath'd when nak'd, viſited and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when ſick and impriſon'd,</hi> ever give me up to an Eternity of flames!</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But yet this is not the whole of the object of our Charity; there are, whoſe <hi>ſouls</hi> are poor, diſeas'd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs'd, as well as their bodies, and can an ulcer'd Leg, or withered Arm, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my pity more than a leprous ſoul! can I chuſe but melt and ſoften at a ſight which ſpeaks a <hi>preſent,</hi> and boades <hi>a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miſery!</hi> is the eternal welfare of my Brother grown, ſo contemptible in my fight, that I'le not ſpend an hour or word to enſure it!

                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42889:54"/>Well then, I will go and viſit ſick ſouls, I will preſcribe, and preſſe, and Watch, and Court, and if I ſee them profligate beyond the hopes of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I'le recommend them, as I do depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends, in Prayers and Tears to God; and whatever the ſucceſs prove to <hi>them,</hi> it will be kind and favourable <hi>to me,</hi> Angels will offer up the incenſe of my Prayers, and bottle up my Tears as well as thoſe ſpent on my own ſins; and my God will multiply and encreaſe my Talents, when he ſees that I ſpend them well; and the World will Love me, and the very wicked will praiſe and juſtifie my God, for theſe effects of his good ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. But nature it ſelf ſeems to encline us to theſe Acts of Charity, as far as they concern the <hi>Relief</hi> of the neceſſitous, the <hi>comfort</hi> of the afflicted, and <hi>Miniſtry</hi> to ſouls; nor can we ſhare in <hi>humanity,</hi> but that we muſt pertake of ſome degrees of, and aptneſſes to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: the moſt difficult part of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is ſtill behind, <hi>i.e.</hi> the <hi>forgiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,</hi> or more, the <hi>returning good for evil,</hi> and yet if we will be the followers
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42889:55"/>
of our bleſſed Saviour, the Children of our Heavenly Father. This is it, that we muſt labour after, that our ſouls may be ſo exalted and heavenly, ſo good and holy, that they may not be eaſily ruffled into peeviſhneſs and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, much leſs rankle into a ſettled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and a reſolv'd revenge, but that they may be all calm and ſmoothneſs, all Love and ſweetneſs.</p>
                     <p>Then indeed we may think our ſelves the Children of God, when we can look upon injuries done us with the <hi>mildneſs,</hi> which ariſes from a ſenſe of our own <hi>frailties;</hi> with a <hi>meekneſs,</hi> which is grounded upon our own <hi>worthleſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> with a <hi>compos'dneſs</hi> of midn which remits all to an Almighty and wiſe God; and with a <hi>compaſſion</hi> which the <hi>conſideration</hi> of their folly, and ſin doth awaken in us: when we can have the Charity to believe a juſt cauſe of mens actions <hi>conceal'd</hi> tho we can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver none: or if the malice be as plain and evident as the wrong, then if we can pray for thoſe who curſe us, honour and Love thoſe who treat us with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight and ſcorn, if we can ſupport the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42889:55"/>
intereſt, and buoy up the reputation, of thoſe who have us'd us, ſhamefully and ungratefully, after we have Lov'd, and after we have ſerv'd them; if we can do this, then indeed the ſpirit of the Goſpel, a Spirit of Peace and Love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in us.</p>
                     <p>And that I may arrive at this perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I reaſon thus with my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true he hath wrong'd me, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were, for conquering wrongs what need have I of Chriſtian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience! Where is the meekneſs of the Chriſtian ſpirit, if I am hurried away by the ſame paſſion with an Heathen and Infidel! I look for my reward from God not man, and therefore I am not at all concern'd, that he doth not requite my kindneſs by gratitude in his behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. I am the Diſciple of Chriſt, who laid down his life for his enemies, and the Child of that God, who is kind even to Rebels and ſinners, and why ſhould I think it enough to divide my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes only amongſt my friends. I am preſs'd by the Conſcience of a duty, and I do not ſo much mind an injury, as in what manner I am oblig'd to receive it,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42889:56"/>
leaſt I tranſgreſs as much by <hi>impatience,</hi> as mine enemy hath done by <hi>injuſtice.</hi> I love my own peace and reſt, and would not be diſorder'd, and breed a ſtorm and tempeſt in my boſome, for why ſhould I be ſo fooliſh, as to transform another mans <hi>ſin</hi> into my <hi>puniſhment:</hi> and laſtly, I am now upon my journey, and am haſtening toward my Heaven, and I would not be ſtopp'd and detain'd in my way, much leſs turn'd out of it, by the ſillineſs and impertinency of a trifling ſinner.</p>
                     <p>And beſides all this, I conſider, that theſe men who wrong me, tho thus kind and unjuſt they are yet my brethren, the workmanſhip of my Fathers hands, the purchaſe of my dear Lord and Maſters blood, partakers of the ſame promiſe, and ſalvation, (unleſs they receive the Grace of God in vain,) and how can I do any thing to them but pray for 'em and bleſs them.</p>
                     <p>Yet after all, being ſtill but mortal, but fleſh and blood, ſome little aptneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to impatience and revenge may remain in me, and therefore if at any time my blood begin to <hi>Chafe</hi> my Choler
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42889:56"/>
boil, my Spirits chill with envy, or muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with deſpight: I retire from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking object to my God, and am not at reſt till I have laid the evil ſpirit, till I have ſtifled the ſin in its firſt throws and pangs; I bemoan my unhappy nature, and bluſh at my own weakneſſes, and <hi>ſtrive,</hi> and <hi>meditate,</hi> and <hi>read,</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> till my Tears refreſh me, and my repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance eaſe me, and upon this ſometimes, I find an extroardinary calm and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs, enſue, ſuch as <hi>I</hi> fancy that of a demoniack, when the ill ſpirit was caſt out, or of one ſuddenly cur'd of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe by th' Almightineſs of our Saviours word; ſometimes I continue a little hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and oppreſs'd, as when the ill ſpirit went out, yet ſo as to rend the man, and then (not leaving off, but in ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons repeating my inſtances to God,) I betake my ſelf to ſomething which may divert my thoughts and deceive my pain.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In the ſurvey of my daily Deportment, which I make each night, I drag forth the Crime into the awful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of an holy God; and there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigning it of all the <hi>miſchiefs</hi> it hath
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42889:57"/>
done me, of all the <hi>troubles</hi> it hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me, and laying before my ſelf ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and devoutly all the obligations I have to the practice of the contrary vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, I condemn it, with an holy indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I cover my ſelf with ſhame, and ſorrow, and renew moſt ſolemn reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt it, and earneſtly beg of God his aſſiſtance againſt his and mine enemy.</p>
                     <p>This is a method which will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly lead us to a moſt certain conqueſt, for it doth naturally tend to <hi>ſoften and calm</hi> the mind, to poſſeſs it with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter degrees <hi>of meekneſs,</hi> and deeper <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions</hi> for cauſeleſs wrath; and it ſets the ſoul upon its <hi>Watch and Guard,</hi> ſo that it cannot be frequently ſurpriz'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to paſſion; and laſtly, it engages the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit</hi> in the quarrel, which ſure is no impotent aſſiſtance:</p>
                     <p>And therefore I cannot for my life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile this deportment each night, with a repeated frowardneſs and peeviſhneſs each day, much leſs with anger digeſted into a ſullen hatred; ſuch (I am afraid) do not <hi>ſtrive</hi> and therefore they do not <hi>conquer;</hi> they neglect the means God
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42889:57"/>
preſcribes them, and therefore he doth not vouchſafe to relieve them; either they do not at all examine and repent in the preſence of God; or elſe they do it tranſiently and perfunctorily; or elſe they <hi>Love</hi> the ſin, and therefore <hi>conceal</hi> and <hi>ſhelter</hi> it; or elſe they are <hi>fond</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to themſelves, and therefore <hi>cover</hi> and <hi>excuſe it;</hi> and any of theſe falts is enough to undo them.</p>
                     <p>Having taken this ſurvey of Charity, it is now time in the laſt place to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by what powerful motives, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel obligeth us to this duty;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt, may be taken from the <hi>nature of Charity</hi> it ſelf; it is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.

                     <p>

It is a vertue that conſtitutes a part of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and helps to make up the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that ſtate of moſt perfect bliſs; and certainly if we could but imitate the <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>perfections</hi> of Heaven, we ſhould in the ſame degrees and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion pertake of its happineſs too, and <hi>that</hi> which is one of the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of the pleaſure of the other World, would if practic'd be no ſmall addition to <hi>that</hi> of this:</p>

                     <p>The natural influences deducible from hence are, that he, who loves God muſt love his Neighbour alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot be the Child of God, nor acceptable to him without ſharing of that bleſſed affection which God hath for the world; and tho the provocation of a Neighbour may have very juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd him into hatred and deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, yet he cannot refuſe his pardon to the requeſts of a God who hath done ſo much for him, and of Jeſus who hath died for him.

for we are become both Criminals and Judges at once, and whilſt we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give <hi>others</hi> we are merciful to ourſelves, and whilſt we revenge and hate <hi>others</hi> we are cruel and barbarous to ourſelves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Goſpel eſtabliſheth a <hi>cloſer Relation</hi> between mankind than that of Nature: by the communion of the ſame Faith, the ſame Spirit, the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (whereof one is but a holy league of Charity) and ſo in one word we are incorporated, and become all but mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame body: and therefore as in <hi>Joſeph</hi> nature prevail'd above the ſenſe of wrongs, and remembring not that they were his enemies, but that they were his Brethren, he fell upon their necks and kiſſed them, and wept through joy and tenderneſs towards thoſe Brethren, who without the leaſt ſoftneſs or relenting had expos'd him, if not to a certain death, to baniſhment and ſlavery: ſo muſt we Chriſtians, remembring by what ties we are faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and united, no more harm or hate one another than we would our own limbs, our own Bodies:</p>

                     <p n="2">2. What a <hi>Streſs</hi> God layes upon this duty; how dear a value he hath for it; that Charity is the very Life and Soul of Religion; and that to be a Chriſtian without Charity is an unnatural contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: And therefore</p>
                     <p>It cannot chooſe but raiſe my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obſerve thar there are a ſort of

people, who tho' they do no harm, do no good neither; who ſtudy nothing but their proper intereſt and pleaſure, and ſo if juſt (which is the moſt) are far from Charitable; and yet they hope to be ſav'd.

                  <p n="1">1. What rules of Temperance it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What motives to the duty it makes uſe of; and</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What method it enjoyns for the attainment of this grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:42889:61"/>1. <hi>Of the Rules of Temperance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The common Rule and Standard which moſt have made uſe of to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct men in eating and drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is <hi>the end of thoſe Acts,</hi> that is the health and ſtrength, (the welfare) of the body, but I have great reaſon to diſlike of this Rule, for if extended any further than to eating and drinking, it is apparently falſe; and, I hope, none will affirm, that all thoſe pleaſures, which are not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the welfare of the body, are therefore not inconſiſtent with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; being applyed to eating and drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a ſtrict and cloſe ſenſe, it layes a ſnare for mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and muſt reduce all to the meer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of Nature, and ſo many enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are innocent enough, nay ſometimes upon ſome emergences neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, will be utterly ſinful; and Religion will be made a meer burden, and mens minds be fill'd with endleſs ſcruples: if taken in as wide a ſence, as ſome men, I ſee, underſtand it, it opens a gap to ſenſuality and unchriſtian freedomes, for I do not queſtion but that any man without prejudice to the happineſs of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42889:62"/>
his body, may be guilty of intemperance in that notion that I have of it; that is, any man may eat or drink to the enrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his luſt, to the ſoftening and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualizing of his mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the hazard of a Fever or a head ach: On theſe accounts I cannot but look upon this Rule as very uſeleſs and improper, if not dangerous for a Chriſtian, and a proper rule of nature only in ſuch a ſtate which hath no proſpect of another life; and therefore I think my ſelf oblig'd to inquire in the Goſpel for better. I think then we ſhall eaſily find what it is the Goſpel means by temperance, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What is the end it aims at in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning this Duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By what words it deſcribes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The examples of our Saviour and his followers in this point. Likewiſe the motives it adds, and the method it preſcribes, will ſerve to clear up its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to us.</p>
                  <p>The great end St <hi>Paul</hi> ſuggeſts to me, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.25. Every man who ſtriveth for the Maſtery is temperate, in all things;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42889:62"/>
intimating that the means are then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when they are ſuited and fitted for the attainment of their end; and by the alluſion implying that the end of our Temperance is a ſtriving for the Maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is a Conqueſt over the World, and the body; for the Goſpel repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the World and the Fleſh, as thoſe enemies, againſt which the Chriſtian is to be engag'd in a continual warfare, and tells us, that the luſts and pleaſures of them do War againſt the Soul. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion being nothing elſe but the Love of God and heavenly things, the Goſpel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours all that it can to wean us from all fondneſs for, or delight in, the world and the fleſh; it being impoſſible to ſerve two ſuch contrary intereſts: By a clear conſequence from all this, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that we are to endure hardſhip as good Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt; that we are to abſtain from fleſhly luſts as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and pilgrims; in plainer words, that that abſtinence from ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which renders the body tame and governable, ſerviceable to the ſoul, and chearful in the exerciſe of Religion, which doth enfranchiſe the mind of men
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42889:63"/>
from its captivity to ſenſe, which doth eſtabliſh its dominion over the brutiſh part; ſo that the man lives the life of faith, and not of ſenſe, is diſengag'd from the World, and ſo ready to depart; is that Temperance which the Goſpel of Chriſt requires: and by conſequence on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, that that indulgence to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures, which tends to pamper and enrage the body, to awaken our paſſions for this preſent ſtate, to endear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the World to us, to make the minds of men ſoft and feeble, heavy and ſenſual, to make our temper delicate and wanton, unable to ſuffer, and froward, if our appetite be not ſatisfied, is flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradictory to the Temperance of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This is a Rule, which if well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and conſcientiouſly applyed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular, will ſufficiently conduct man in the paths of this great duty, and anſwer all ſcruples concerning the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of pleaſures, whether they be real or phantaſtick ones. For is any man ſuch a ſtranger to himſelf, that he doth not underſtand the working of his own ſoul: that he cannot give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42889:63"/>
of the paſſions which he feels nor, know by what methods he is betray'd into the Love of the World, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of his Religion. Doth not every man feel what kind of eating and drinking clogs the ſoul and emboldens the body; what kind of ſights or dalliance doth dart the poiſon of luſt and ambition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our very ſouls? Or what doth thaw and melt us, and make us Love and hate, delight or grieve, hope and fear like the Children, not of Light but of the World; certainly unleſs a man will impoſe upon himſelf, he muſt needs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the birth, and growth of his own Paſſions, and diſcover the methods by which he doth inſenſibly degenerate into a looſe, or cold, or ſenceleſs Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Temperance is in general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in Holy Writ by <hi>Mortification,</hi> and <hi>Holyneſs:</hi> the former imports ſuch a change in the body, as flattens and deads its appetites for the World; <hi>I am cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the World, and the World is crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me:</hi> The latter imports, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Godlike nature, a transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans into a ſpiritual a frame, as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42889:64"/>
man in this imperfect State is capable of arriving at.</p>
                  <p>And certainly, men thus qualified can not place their delight in the ſenſual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this life, how innocent ſoever they might be, the World hath nothing <hi>agreeable</hi> to ſouls of this Heavenly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor nothing <hi>worthy</hi> of them: Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in the particular branches of it, is call'd, Purity, Sobriety, Abſtinence, Modeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted; according to the method of the Spirit, in a ſenſe which doth not onely reſtrain the outward Acts, but alſo the inward paſſions of man, in a ſenſe which doth not onely forbid the commiſſion of groſs ſins, but alſo all tendencies towards them in the body, and in the ſoul: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to this Doctrine were</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The lifes and examples of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeſus, and his followers, (tho' perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it would not be altogether er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational to ſuppoſe, that the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meaſures of the Divine Spirit, in his immediate Diſciples, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the bleſſed Jeſus, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the freſh memory of all his Power and Glory, might render a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42889:64"/>
diſcipline the leſs neceſſary) I will not deny but that our bleſſed Maſter, did often accept of entertainments, (nor did I ever deſign to forbid any ſuch thing on particular occaſions, which may warrant them) but it is eaſie to obſerve, how courſe, and plain, and ſparing his conſtant Diet, with his Diſciples was, how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in his faſtings, and his watchings, he was: As for his Diſciples after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, their lives were but a conſtant warfare, and the World, and the fleſh their enemies; they Liv'd like ſtrangers and Pilgrims upon earth, and their pleaſures were altogether Spiritual and Holy.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the paths that they trod towards conqueſt, and a glorious Crown; and I can eaſily conceive how their Life was fill'd with ſuch ſpiritual raviſhments; how they long'd for the appearance of Chriſt, and how they left the World with ſuch glorious aſſurances as that, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith</hi> (all which may have regard not only to his ſufferings, but alſo to his conflict with the fleſh too) <hi>henceforth, there is laid up
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42889:65"/>
for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the Righteous Judge ſhall give me at that Day; and not to me onely, but unto them alſo that Love his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, how that ſofteneſs of converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that full and luxurious feeding and drinking, that gariſhneſs and wantonneſs of dreſs, that ſloth and lazyneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is ſo univerſal in the world, can become the life of a Souldier of Chriſt, I am not wiſe, nor lucky enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
                  <p>But I can now eaſily diſcern from whence it proceeds, that Religion ſeems ſo unpleaſant a thing, and that men are ſo unwilling to depart hence into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, it is becauſe we are ſuch imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Chriſtians, and we live ſenſually.</p>
                  <p>It will therefore behove us, to lay to heart the great motives, by which the Goſpel engages us to this duty, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The nature of our preſent State in this World, the poor ſoul lives in a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous body, and a tempting World, both which conſpire its ruin; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be upon its watch, upon its guard; it is not a time for mirth, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42889:65"/>
pleaſure, and feaſting, when the enemy hath ſeiz'd the outworks, and entred into the very Subburbs; the ſoul is ſtriving for the Maſtery, and is it ſenſe to arm its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and feed it into a fierce and brutiſh courage? by indulging to thoſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are the food and fuel to its luſts? every ſenſual pleaſure it indulges to the body is a plain giving ground before the face of its enemy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reward of this ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which is fullneſs of pleaſures in the life to come, an Eternity of bliſs and happineſs; and how rational is it to prefer Eternity to a moment, and that exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weight of glory and unſpeakable, unconceiveable pleaſure, to the dreams and mockeries of this imperfect State? even in this preſent life, we think it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our wiſdome to renounce trifling pleaſures out of the proſpect of greater; what a Diſcipline of ſeverities, did thoſe contenders in the Grecian games run through out of the hopes of honour and applauſe? from whence St. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently argues, if <hi>they did this for a corruptible Crown</hi> (a Crown of Leaves,) <hi>how much more ſhould the Chriſtian for an incorruptible one?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:42889:66"/>3. The example of a whole Cloud of witneſſes gone to Heaven before us, who preſs'd in thorough this narrow <hi>way and ſtrait gate;</hi> but eſpecially the conſideration of a crucified Saviour; for what have we to do, who have taken up the Croſs of Chriſt, with rioting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with Chambering and wantonneſs? What reſemblance is there between his Crown of Thorns, his Scourging, his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the ſecurity and ſloth, the gaiety and vanity of a ſenſual life? for ſhame, let thoſe, who profeſs Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity do ſomething which may become men who have taken up the Banner of the Croſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The great advantage and pleaſure of the State of Mortification. 1. The Soul enjoys a more entire peace, a more abſolute empire, and is not alarm'd by the daily mutinies of rebellious luſts. 2. It is become a fit Temple for the Spirit of purity to dwell in, for the Spirit of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and of God to reſt upon, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this will be abundance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pleaſure, of peace, and joy, and hope.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The uncertainty of the time of our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42889:66"/>
Saviours appearance to judgement, and who, that hath a grain of ſenſe, would be ſurpriz'd by that day at unawares? who would be overtaken by the Judge of the World, in ſurfieting and drunkenneſs, or any other of the ſinful pleaſures of this Life.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>This is the Ornament and Guard of all our Graces, that which ſets off and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates all our excellencies, and keeps us upon our Watch to ſecure them; it is both the foundation and perfection of all virtue; even holineſs and goodneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, would be unacceptable to God; and therefore it is well worth your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in the next place.</p>
                  <p>Humility is a mean opinion, or rather the true knowledge of our ſelves, a ſober contemplation of our infirmities, and a real perſwaſion of our imperfection: which is St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſobriety of Spirit, or humility of mind, contrary to the being puff'd up.</p>
                  <p>The ſenſe of this ſhedding it ſelf upon the will, renders men modeſt in <hi>their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,</hi> and humble in their deportment, which is that other part of humility, whereby a man is enabled to reject praiſe and honour, and to debaſe himſelf to the meaneſt offices; thus the bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <hi>ſought not his own honour, and he came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter.</hi>

                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:42889:67"/>There are three things, which are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be made the grounds of pride, the gifts of Grace, of Nature, and of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: but the humble man, in reſpect of the gifts of Grace, looks not upon what he hath attain'd but what is ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; he payes his ſacrifice of honour, not to that earthen veſſel, which contains the treaſure, but to the God from whoſe fulneſs it is deriv'd; he dwells not upon the pleaſing ſpectacle of his good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but moſtly on the catalogue of his frailties and his ſins, and therefore reſts himſelf on the mercy of God thorough the blood of Chriſt, and from freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentances, he takes up freſh reſolutions and Spirits every Day.</p>
                  <p>As to the gifts of Fortune, the World is too much a trifle in the ſight of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd underſtanding, to raiſe in a good man, any eſteem or Love of it, and if ſo, a man can never prize himſelf for the poſſeſſion of what he ſlights, nor be proud of what he deſpiſes.</p>
                  <p>As to the gifts of Nature, he muſt value them as they are the gifts of God, but he conſiders withal, that they are but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ones, and are but the imperfect orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42889:68"/>
of this imperfect State, which muſt be done away, when we come into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and withal he reflects often upon his blemiſhes and imperfections, his follies and miſcarriages, and conſidering how poor, miſerable, and comfortleſs a thing, he ſhould have been, if abandon'd to the conduct of Nature, he layes his mouth in the duſt, and at once admires the bounty and Goodneſs of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes his own vanity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The fruit of this humility, is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſubjection, &amp; reſignation of ones ſelf to God, meekneſs and patience towards man, a calm and tranquillity in ones own boſome; for as to God, conſidering him as infinitely Glorious, and himſelf intirely dependent of him, the humble man compoſes himſelf to believe all he reveals to obey what he commands, to truſt in him, to attend the Decrees, and the leiſure of Heaven, to ſuffer meekly, and enjoy modeſtly: As to himſelf, out of the conſcience of how little he deſerves, he is neither ambitious of wealth nor honour, but he is thankful for the paſt, ſatisfied with the preſent, and neither impatient for, nor diſtruſtful of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42889:68"/>
And out of a ſenſe of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition to good, and the weakneſs of his own ſtrength, he bleſſes God for the grace he hath receiv'd, and tho he ſtands he takes heed leaſt he fall. As to his Neighbour, out of the diſtruſt of his own abilities, the ſenſe of his own infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or elſe taught by the example of his great Maſter, who took upon himſelf the form of a Servant, the humble man is more forward to obey than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to believe than to diſpute, he is ſlow to ſpeak, ſwift to hear, not fond of opinions, but deſirous to be enlighten'd by God, and inform'd by man; — and therefore on all theſe accounts, an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Man, can never be enthuſiaſtical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate or ſeditious, for he can never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at that height of Spiritual pride as to conceit himſelf the onely favourite of Heaven, and fit for extroardinary illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; nor at that height of carnal pride, as to be a buiſie body, a ſtiff aſſerter of his own humour, or judg of his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours on earth, and ſo think himſelf more fit to Reign than to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>In one word, Humilities whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment is ſweet and gentle, its very zeal is modeſt, its reprehenſion ſoft and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42889:69"/>
its Prayers awful, its reflections mournful, and its hopes of Heaven ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly growing; it is neither ſevere nor pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, obſtinate nor haſty, bold nor ſelfiſh inſolent nor querulous, it can ſuffer its wounds to be prov'd and ſearch'd, and kiſſes the hand, whileſt it loaths the filth, it doth not inſult o're anothers errours nor excuſe its own, nay rather its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty conceals its beauties, and bluſhes at the diſcovery of its own excellencies, it never proſtitutes to beg praiſes, nay if it accidentally meet them, it is rather bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd and oppreſs'd, than puff'd up by them. I will then account my ſelf to have attain'd to ſome degree of this grace when I can poſſeſs my ſoul at reſt, when I delight in the milk of Gods word, more than its heights and entricacies in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience more than diſputes and fancies, when I can receive evil from the hand of God, as well as good; when I can ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice my own will to the caprice of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, the obſtinacy of an inferiour, or the humour of an equal; when I can ſuffer wrongfully, and yet meekly; when I can look upon the glories and the power of this World; and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42889:69"/>
ſay I am not born for theſe, I am not call'd to the enjoyment of theſe, but of the Croſs here, and Glory hereafter, I am to tread in the ſteps of my dear Lord and Maſter, and nothing ſhall make me have any other deſigns than thoſe he had; and when I have done all this and am aſſur'd that I love and ſerve my God, I relie onely upon the merits and ſufferings of my Saviour for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a Crown.</p>
                  <p>This duty of Humility is the moſt <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and the moſt <hi>difficult</hi> in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the moſt <hi>uſeful</hi> for it, recommends us to God, indears us to men, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes a Peace, and calm in our own boſomes: — the moſt <hi>difficult</hi> for it is to renounce what is moſt near and dear to us, our intereſt and pleaſures, our reputation, nay our very ſelves, our underſtanding, will and affections;</p>
                  <p>There are two mighty motives wich are moſt inſiſted on by the holy Spirit; the one is that Humility is the way to the increaſe of Grace here, and to greater meaſures of Glory hereafter; <hi>God reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the proud and giveth grace to the humble,</hi> and <hi>he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted:</hi> the other is the example
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42889:70"/>
of our Saviour, who tho ſo great as to be the Son of God, and to think it no Robbery to be equal to God, ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent that he had no guilt upo him, none could accuſe him of ſin, ſo dignified as to be Prophet, Prieſt, and King, did yet debaſe himſelf to the meaneſt ſervices, on purpoſe that he might leave his Diſciples a pattern to imitate; tho he were adorn'd by all that might give him a juſt claim to Honour, as Birth, Virtue, and the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the moſt illuſtrious functions, yet he was as much the humbleſt as he was the greateſt, as much the moſt meek as the moſt innocent of the Sons of Men; and if he our Lord and Maſter ſtoopt ſo low, what can we, who are at that vaſt diſtance beneath him, do or ſuffer, that is capable of diſparaging us.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe conſiderations, it will be very uſeful towards implanting humility in us, to know God and our ſelves: his Dayes are without Beginning or End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his perfections have no bounds; he is Independent and immutable; he is his own Heaven, and his own happineſs: but we are duſt, and the Sons of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, born yeſterday, and we ſhall
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42889:70"/>
dye to morrow; our bodies heavy, ſluggiſh, crafie, beings of a few ſpans long; our ſouls are blind and ambitious, paſſionate, froward, jealous, inconſtant, fooliſh things: <hi>thoſe</hi> are the ſeat or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode of numerous pains and diſeaſes, <hi>Theſe</hi> of as numerous, and as painful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: the World we live in, is a meer phantaſm and cheat; that firſt invites, and then deludes our appetites; for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment it ſelf is but a dying itch, and the mockery of a waking dream: the time paſt reflects our ſins and follies; the preſent is troubled with regret, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and vexations; and the future will be what the preſent now is; for when all is nothing, what can be the end of our hopes and cares, but diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And all this conſider'd, is not God moſt fit to Govern, and we to obey! he to be exalted, and we to be humbled! but why do I compare Man to God! let us compare him but to the Angels of God, and how inconceiveably more excellent is their being, and their ſtate, than ours; how wiſe and knowing! how refin'd and pure their ſubſtances! we ſee but thorough a Cloud, and are clad

                  <p>It is an opinion generally receiv'd, that the leaſt degree of true Faith will ſave the ſoul: but I hope men mean ſuch a degree of it, as overcomes the World, and ſubdues the Fleſh; for otherwiſe I ſhould very much queſtion, whether it be not that ſeed which <hi>becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unfruitful, thorough the cares of the World, and deceitfulneſs of riches, and the luſts of other things,</hi> Mar. 4.19.— If they ſay that that Faith, which doth not overcome the World and the Fleſh is not <hi>true</hi> Faith, it is as broad as long, for not to diſpute whether (in the place mention'd) the reaſons of unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was in the ſeed or in the ground, whether it be <hi>true</hi> Faith or not, I'me
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42889:72"/>
ſure it is not <hi>ſaving</hi> Faith; ſo that the Rule given us, whereby to diſcern and judge of our ſtate, is a very plain and eaſie one, <hi>viz. He that overcometh the World is born of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it ſhould be further inquir'd, how a man ſhall know whether he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the World (tho he may with as much ſenſe ask me, how he ſhall know what he loves and hates? what he ſhuns and perſues?) the anſwer is very plain, <hi>his Servants ye are to whom you obey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the whole State of this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be in few words reduc'd to this, no man can be a ſtranger to his own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor to the operations of his own ſoul: <hi>what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man, which is in him,</hi> which words (if I have any logick) contain two things. 1. That a man knowes his own mind, (or if he do not, then.) 2. That no man elſe can: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince a man knows his own actions and his own affections, what he <hi>doth,</hi> and out of what principles he <hi>doth</hi> it, he cannot chuſe but know, who it is he obeyes; but if his Life be ſo various, ſo made up of vice and virtue, and the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42889:72"/>
fleſh and ſpirit be ſo evenly pois'd, that <hi>which</hi> hath the preheminence, whom he obeyes be a matter very <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>diſputable</hi> to himſelf, then whether he ſhall be ſaved or no, muſt remain to himſelf, and much more to all others (God alone excepted) equally <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> and I can gueſs at no other expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for him, if he hath a mind to rid himſelf of this ſcruple, than entirely to compleat his conqueſt over ſin, and to ſhake off that empire over ſin, which it ſeems to me hath been too long and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettled and eſtabliſhed; and to go on from one degree of grace unto another, till he arrives at <hi>Perfection:</hi> (which is the only method to obtain, that full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of hope mention'd. <hi>Heb</hi> 6 11.)</p>
                  <p>With which I intend now to cloſe this firſt part of my diſcourſe <hi>of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſtianity,</hi> becauſe tho it be not a particular <hi>grace,</hi> it is a particular <hi>ſtate,</hi> and therefore deſerves a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſideration, and tho we be not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to it, upon <hi>pain of Damnation,</hi> yet we are invited and encourag'd to it, by ſeveral glorious motives and enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ſhall preſently appear; and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42889:73"/>
therefore it is a Goſpel duty: by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (in the ſenſe I now conſider it) the Goſpel implies a State of Grace ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at its full maturity and ſtrength, grown into <hi>Nature,</hi> and conſummated into a vigorous and delightful <hi>habit;</hi> it being in <hi>this</hi> as in all other qualities, they grow up into habit and nature, that is, Perfection by degrees;</p>
                  <p>According to this, the Goſpel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes this State by Manhood, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Stature; and calls our procedure to it, growing, encreaſing, and going on; ſo that perfection is nothing elſe but Faith, Love, Temperance, and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in their greateſt luſtre and ſtrength:</p>
                  <p>The effect of this State is, that the Life be not onely <hi>conſtant, firm, even,</hi> and <hi>like it ſelf,</hi> but alſo <hi>pleaſant</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful</hi> too; not only that the man ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from evil and do good, but that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he do both with <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> of ſpirit, with <hi>eaſe</hi> and with delight; not onely that he do good, but what is in its kind <hi>moſt</hi> ſo;</p>
                  <p>This is a State which is attainable in this Life, for the Goſpel calls and invites men to it; and if any deny it, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42889:73"/>
they frame to themſelves ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of notion of perfection than the Goſpel delivers us, which requires of Man no other perfection than ſuch as is ſuitable to his Nature, and the aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces promis'd by God, and to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, never as much as dreaming that perfection is the ſame thing in man, as in an Angel and, (what ever men may talk) it doth not reckon the unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imperfections and frailties of men for ſins, at leaſtwiſe ſuch as can hinder man from being denominated perfect, witneſs the whole Firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The motives to this duty may be compriz'd under Four heads all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the nature of the State it ſelf. Perfection is a State.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. More pleaſing to God; if God Loves holineſs, (which no body can doubt) then every degree of holineſs is a new charm, and what is moſt Holy is moſt lovely; and if ſo every one that profeſſes to Love God, muſt be oblig'd
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42889:74"/>
to aim at perfection, becauſe he cannot but be oblig'd to pleaſe God as much as he can; and he that doth not, may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpect his conformity to the divine precepts to be rather policy than Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to proceed from a deſire of his own ſafety, rather than the Glory and pleaſure of God; unleſs a ſpiritual pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhall reſtrain him from attempts or vowes of more Heroical inſtances of obedience, for Reaſons which Religion may approve of; in which caſe it will be alwayes neceſſary to obſerve this caution, <hi>that his choice of a better good do not proceed from any deſire of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body, or from want of Love to God and holineſs.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Perfection is a ſtate of greater ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; the more ſtrong Faith and Love grow, the more faint and flat, are all temptations that beſet us; a ſoul which is devout and rais'd, is not eaſily lur'd down by any of the flatteries of luſt; the ſoul being long accuſtomed to rule, and the body to obey, the ſoul being us'd to ſpiritual delights, and the body being now perfectly crucified, the man is become a quite different being from what he was, and therefore that World which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42889:74"/>
did before take him, hath now no grace nor allurement in it; <hi>I am crucified to the World, and the World is crucified to me.</hi> This State is call'd in Scripture, <hi>Wiſdom, and Knowledge, and Strength,</hi> which doth intimate to us, that that World, which did before gain upon us only by our blindneſs, and our weakneſs, can now no longer prevail; beſides this, the more like God we grow, the more dear are we to him, and become the more near and peculiar charge of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 6, 9.10. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges for a reaſon, <hi>why he was perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better things of them</hi> (than Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) <hi>and things that accompany Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (that is perſeverance) becauſe <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of Love,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a State of greater pleaſure: a State of Peace and Reſt from ſin, for the Man, having eſtabliſh'd an entire conqueſt over himſelf, is not frequently alarm'd by the luſts of the body, becauſe it is crucified; the ſoul being rais'd and Heavenly is now too much exalted to be reach'd by the blaſts of every temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. 2. It is the nature of a habit
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42889:75"/>
that its acts are eaſie and delightful; for Habit is but another Nature (ſo Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is call'd in Scripture a new Nature) and what is natural is pleaſant; when our graces are full of Life and Vigour, when our ſight is grown clearer and our affections warmer, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God and Heaven; then it is that we begin to enjoy the ſweets of Religion, that we anticipate our Heaven, by performing his will on earth, as it is done in Heaven; Religion is at firſt employed in the unpleaſant tho wholeſome ſeverities, of cutting off Right Hands, and pulling out Right Eyes, Luſts become ſo natural they were become our members; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, having <hi>conquer'd the World, his commandements are not grievous,</hi> but full of delight and ſatisfaction; in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as in the alteration of an Old building, we firſt demoliſh thoſe parts, which are not uniform and beautiful, and this preſents us with nothing but rubbiſh and ruins, but afterwards we raiſe up an orderly, beautiful and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome building, where we may ſolace and entertain our ſelves; 3. An Exalted Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42889:75"/>
is not only delightſome in the very acts and exerciſes of its graces, but in the fruits and effects of them; <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> are the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of this State of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and its actions, becauſe ſuch a mans Love of God is now ſo evident and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, he hath no longer room to doubt of it; and then what a raviſhing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure muſt it be, to be able to ſurvey all the glorious promiſes of the Goſpel as ſuch which himſelf is an heir to? who can with full aſſurance, think himſelf juſt upon the confines of Heaven, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a moment of entring into joy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a very ſenſible tranſport!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It's entitled to greater meaſures of Glory in the Life to come: Tho the loweſt degree of future glory be above the merit of the moſt holy Life, and tho God may do what he will with his own, ſo that the chiefeſt Saint could not have juſt reaſon to complain, tho the meaneſt were equall'd with him: yet it is plain that there will be order in another World, and thoſe ſtars of the Morning of the Reſurrection will differ in Glory, and this will be proportion'd
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42889:76"/>
to their Behaviour in this life; <hi>he which ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reap ſparingly, and he which ſoweth bountifully ſhall reap bountifully,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. Is it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore highly reaſonable on this account that we ſhould aſpire after the greateſt degrees of Holineſs we can, for who would not deſire to be <hi>as happy and as glorious</hi> as he can.</p>
                  <p>It is now apparent, that perfection is a duty propos'd to us, upon very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and glorious motives; for who that is wiſe will not take pains to arrive at that perfection, which is a State of greater ſecurity, greater eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, more acceptable to God, and en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titled to greater degrees of Glory in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>For the attainment of this State ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe few Rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Believe a Holy, Juſt, Almighty God, every where preſent; <hi>neither is there any Creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight; but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4.13. <hi>Nay, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things.</hi> If Heaven be his Throne, Earth is his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42889:76"/>
Footſtool, and therefore walk not, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as preparing to meet him, but as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready before him: this will awe a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ſpirit, and it will not be eaſie to fear and ſin; and it will awaken a decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affection, and it will not be eaſie to omit a duty; it will teach us how to judg our actions impartially, and we ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſe upon our ſelvs by fondneſs, nor do any thing for opinion ſake, when we conſider, that we have God for a Judge and Spectator.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the firſt Motive.</p>
               <p>Upon what account Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality is ſaid to be brought to light thorough the Goſpel, I'le not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but it is certain that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhews us how Death is aboliſh'd, and how Life and Immortality may be attain'd; 2 that it hath manifeſted this to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews; and that 3. The Diſcovery of it is in full and clear words laid down in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Page of it:</p>
               <p>The Wicked <hi>ſhall go away into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment, and the Righteous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Life eternal,</hi> Mat. 25. and Ro. 2.5. there is a day mention'd which is call'd <hi>The Day of the Revelation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgement of God,</hi> becauſe <hi>he will</hi> then <hi>render to every man according to his Deeds, to them who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for Glory and honour, and immortality; eternal Life: but unto them that are contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs; indignation and wrath,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42889:81"/>
tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil, of the Jew firſt and alſo of the Gentile, but glory, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and peace to every man that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Gentile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being ſo, to ſin muſt needs be ſo ſilly and weak a thing, no man of common ſenſe would be guilty of; for can any man of reaſon be at a loſs in ſuch a choice as this, whether he will live eternally or die; whether he will be happy for ever, or for a moment: (upon ſuppoſal that ſin could make me live one happy moment.)</p>
               <p>'Tis true, if there were no proſpect of another Life, no account to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in another world, the caſe would be much alter'd; for the Law of our nature being (I humbly conceive) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the Law or Dictates of Reaſon, and the buſineſs of Reaſon being (in this reſpect at leaſt) only to diſtinguiſh between good and evil, our Reaſon would talk to us at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rate, becauſe it would proceed by different principles; good and evil would then peradventure be different
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42889:82"/>
things, for whatever would make for the pleaſure and intereſt of this preſent State would be good; and even plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and intereſt would not peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be the ſame thing <hi>then</hi> that <hi>now;</hi> for the ſoul would not challenge ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct a conſideration or proviſion as now, for it would not be onely lawful but wiſe for it to become <hi>ſenſual and worldly,</hi> and ſo, the ſame pleaſure and intereſt would miniſter to the happineſs of both Body and Soul. But now that we are aſſur'd that we are to live to all Eternity, and that every action of ours hath an influence on that other life, we muſt needs conclude that every action is good or bad, wiſe or fooliſh as it ſerves or hinders our happineſs in that State to come: that this motive may have its full force, it will behove every man to take as lively a ſurvey as he can of the joys and miſeries of another Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And 1. Of Heaven.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſt, that to be able to ſpeak properly of Heaven, we have need, like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to be rapt up into it; for the richeſt fancy would be but flat and barren in its framing any reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42889:82"/>
of the joyes and glory of that place: they are unconceiveable.</p>
               <p>Heaven is like the God of it, there is no ſearching of him out unto perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but yet there is enough of him manifeſted to prove him to us ſtrangely aimable, and therefore I'le conſider what is manifeſted to us of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The perſons, (for the objects, they will fall in with theſe) which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the happineſs of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the Place. Heaven, it is the ſacred abode of God and Angels, and therefore it muſt, as much exceed this World, as <hi>they</hi> do <hi>us,</hi> for no doubt on't the wiſe Architect of all things made each Pallace proper and fit for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that family, it was to receive, and indeed it appears to be a place fit for the Favorits of God to live in, for Heaven is a place of <hi>everlaſting life, and everlaſting happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heaven is the end and conſummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things, all things will there be in their higheſt perfection which they are capable of; we are now the rough draught of what the great Artificer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42889:83"/>
us; imagine to what glory we may be rais'd; we once were dirt and clay, ſee now what comely glorious beings; yet we are to be refin'd much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what we are now, than fleſh and blood is above dirt and clay; what difference there is between Time and Eternity, between corruption and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, ſo much we differ in our exiſtence and eſſence <hi>now,</hi> from what we ſhall be <hi>afterwards;</hi> for mortality muſt be ſwallowed up of immortality and corruption of incorruption.</p>
               <p>If Heaven be a ſtate wherein all things are conſummated, an end which hath none beyond it, then I infer, 1. That there will be nothing more for us either to <hi>hope</hi> or <hi>fear,</hi> all will be full of <hi>quiet,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> no paſſions there but <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Wonder: there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain,</hi> Rev. 21.— 2. Having obtain'd our <hi>end,</hi> we ſhall have no further need of <hi>means</hi> there will be nothing which is to be done meerly for the ſake of ſomething elſe; as here below the covetous man ſuffers hardſhip, and the toil of conſtant
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42889:83"/>
buſineſs, not becauſe he loves trouble, but becauſe he would be rich; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man offers violence to his own body, not becauſe it is actually pleaſant to do ſo, but becauſe it is in order to a greater good; therefore there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this to be done in <hi>Heaven,</hi> all the buſineſs and imployment of that Life, will be <hi>delight and pleaſure;</hi> hence it is every where in Scripture deſcrib'd as a State of <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Reſt,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the Perſons. I a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this World below, I who have felt the troubles of this mortal State, been tortur'd by the paſſions of Fleſh and Bloud, Fears and Cares, Deſpairs and Hopes, even I am going to a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where none of theſe can enter, where I ſhall be made happy, with thoſe enjoyments, which make God and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſo, I ſhall be made <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> equal to the Angels in Heaven, how far above them in my happineſs! for what a value will the experience of this World make me ſet upon the joyes of another! the ſenſe and memory of miſery will make my Heaven double.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:42889:84"/>I conſider that in that Life to come, we ſhall have Soul and Bodies, (tho not ſuch,) as we have now; our Souls will be ſtrangely rais'd and refin'd in their nature, and endow'd with ſtrange mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of knowledge; this compar'd to the <hi>other</hi> Life, being like Childhood to Manhood, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>We know in part,— but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhall be done away, when I was a Child I ſpake as a Child, I underſtood as a Child, I thought as a Child; but when I became a Man I put away Childiſh things; for now we ſee tborough a glaſs darkly, but then face to face, now I know in part, but then ſhall I know, even as alſo I am known;</hi> I am not willing to infer what kind of meaſures of knowledge this Text im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, to determine how well we ſhall be vers'd in the Philoſophy of Grace and Nature, and the World above: how experienc'd we ſhall be in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Hiſtory of this Life and the other; 'tis enough to ſay as the Text doth, that what we do ſee, we ſhall ſee <hi>plainly,</hi> not darkly; and what can we ſee in another Life, but God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:42889:84"/>
How rich a pleaſure this will be, only ingenious and excellent ſpirits are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of fancying: all may be able to gueſs that it will be a moſt unſpeakable pleaſure, becauſe knowledge is one of the Excellencies of God and Angels, and the delight of the wiſer part of Mankind:</p>
               <p>As for the Souls <hi>Affections,</hi> they will ſurely be ſettled on God, or whatever other objects there may be ſubordinate, they will be ſuch as will become ſo pure and holy a Being: for the Appetite of each Being flows from the Conſtitution and Nature of it: it now indeed derives mean and degenerous inclinations from its communion with the Body (whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance is proper for the ſtate it lives in:)</p>
               <p>But then the Body will be rais'd a <hi>ſpiritual glorified</hi> Body, which is to be underſtood in oppoſition to a <hi>carnal natural</hi> one, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. a Body proper to be an Inhabitant of ſuch a place, and to be a ſuitable companion to ſuch a Soul, fit to comply with its deſires, and in ſome meaſure ſure to partake
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42889:85"/>
of its joyes, which I may place as the firſt ingredient of the happineſs of the Body in that Life to come, <hi>i.e.</hi> As it here grieves and joyes in the pain or pleaſure of the Soul, ſo there it will much more: if the ſatisfaction of the Soul, now, do by a happy influence impart health, and chearfulneſs, and pleaſure to the body, it will there much more do ſo; becauſe being rais'd <hi>ſpiritual</hi> it ſeems to me that it will be knit in a <hi>cloſſer</hi> union, and be more capable of thoſe influences: but beſides this, 2. It will have pleaſures agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and natural to it ſelf, which it will reap, 1. From the glory and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it poſſeſſes, which will be one peculiar to it ſelf, and of a different nature from that of the Soul, thus in our Saviour on the Mount, (from whoſe transfiguration we may receive a little light) they were two different things, which made up the beauty of his mind and of his body, Wiſdome, Love, Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were the charmes and graces of his Soul, but light, and glory, and proportion the Majeſty and Beauty of his body: and ſince this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42889:85"/>
will be in its nature diſtinct from the ſoul (for though ſpiritual, it will not be <hi>intelligent</hi>) therefore too it will have objects fit to entertain it; what thoſe objects will be, that I'le not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſcover, the Scripture doth in the general tell us, that the place it ſelf will be fill'd with a mighty glory, that our converſation will be ſtrangely delightfull, that there are things <hi>prepar'd for us,</hi> (which are not therefore God himſelf) <hi>which the eye hath not ſeen &amp;c.</hi> (if that place be to be underſtood of the entertainments of another life.) but leaſt any ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me, I doe not in the leaſt dream of any <hi>groſs</hi> pleaſure: not the pleaſure of the glorified body will be as ſpiritual a the body, and no more; from all that I have ſaid, I infer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the joy and pleaſure of the Life to come is moſt perfect and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, for the more excellent the being the more delicat and refin'd its pleaſure, or elſe there could be no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the happineſs of an Angel that's raviſht with the enjoyment, of Heaven and an Hog that fattens in is ſtie and

grunts at a full meal;) and if ſo, how unconceiveably great will our pleaſures be in that State, wherein the worſe and meaner part of us, our very bodies ſhall be ſpiritual and incorruptible!</p>

                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:42889:91"/>To this purpoſe therefore let us conſider the Nature of God, as it is taught us in the Goſpel of that Son of God who lay in the Boſom of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hath declar'd him to us: And the firſt thing is, that <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> Jo. 4.24. and thoſe Attributes which the Goſpel aſſigns him, and which are a fuller diſcovery of his Nature, are <hi>Knowledge, Wiſdom, Holineſs,</hi> (under which may in the opinion of ſome be comprehended <hi>Goodneſs, Juſtice,</hi>) and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Dominion.</hi> — Now from that reſemblance which <hi>Religion</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the heart hath to theſe, it is call'd the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Image of God;</hi> and it is highly reaſonable, that the worſhip ſhould be ſuitable to the God it is paid to; and therefore the Rule and Standard of Holineſs is the Divine Nature, and nothing elſe; the beauty of Holineſs, and the deformity of ſin, is not to be deriv'd, at leaſt <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily,</hi> from the conveniency or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenieney of the one or other in this preſent life, but from a tendency to imprint or efface this Divine Image in us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:42889:92"/>This is the way of our Saviour's and his Apoſtles arguing from the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> to our <hi>Duty</hi> thus, becauſe God is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> therefore he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd in <hi>Spirit,</hi> and in <hi>Truth;</hi> becauſe he is <hi>pure,</hi> therefore they muſt <hi>purifie</hi> themſelves who approach him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is <hi>holy,</hi> therefore his worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers muſt be holy too; and becauſe he is <hi>love,</hi> therefore they who abide in him muſt abide in <hi>love;</hi> all his Children muſt imitate the perfections of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature — <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence it is eaſie to diſcover why the God of Heaven hath ſuch an Everlaſting Quarrel againſt ſin, and why he delights ſo much in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs: Sin embaſes the man, and depraves the ſpirit which is in him into a ſenſual natural man, and ſets him at the fartheſt diſtance from, and contradiction to God; but Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a reflexion of his own Beauty and Excellency, it is the exalting man into a ſpiritual and heavenly Nature. — This is a plain account of the Nature of Holineſs and Sin, how the one is ſo
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42889:92"/>
lovely, and the other ſo ugly, how the one is ſo dangerous, and the other ſo advantagious.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The knowledge of the Divine Nature convinces us of <hi>the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſerving God:</hi> There can be but two reaſons for ſervice, either 1. <hi>An Obligation to the perſon we ſerve,</hi> and then our ſervice is either <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> or elſe 2. <hi>A regard to our own intereſt or pleaſure.</hi> In the knowledge of the Divine Nature we ſhall find all theſe Obligations to his ſervices. If we conſider God as that Principle <hi>in whom we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17.28. or as <hi>one who doth us good,</hi> gives <hi>us rain from Heaven,</hi> and <hi>fruitful ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſs,</hi> Act. 14.17. What can be more reaſonable, than that we ſhould be thankful to him? but, if we conſider him further, as Redeeming us by the Blood of his Son, inſtructing us by the Light of his Goſpel, aſſiſting us by the Power of his Spirit, and adopting us into the hopes of an Incorruptible Crown; what can be more reaſonable, than that we ſhould devote our ſelves
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42889:93"/>
to his ſervice, and offer up our ſelves a holy, living, and acceptable Sacrifice to him? If we conſider him as our Creator, and the Lord of Heaven and Earth, what can be more reaſonable, than that we his Creatures ſhould obey his Laws?</p>
                  <p>If we have regard to our own <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,</hi> all our preſent enjoyments and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hopes depend upon him; to be guided by Infinite Wiſdom, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by Infinite Power, to be bleſt by him who is above all things, and can make us as happy as he pleaſes, are things which a wiſe love of our ſelves would make us earneſtly deſire: As for pleaſure, beſides that which flows from the perſwaſion of all theſe advantages which accrue to us from his ſervice, and beſides the peace and true freedom which Devotion gains us, there is a ſtrange pleaſure in the contemplation of the moſt Excellent Being, in whom is united all that is any way taking with a Rational and Immortal Soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This knowledge of God will <hi>confirm us in a firm perſwaſion of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Vertue, and puniſhment of Vice:</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:42889:93"/>
for whilſt it diſcovers ſin ſo exceeding hateful, not only upon the account of its contradiction to the Divine Nature, but alſo its baſe ingratitude and folly, and diſcovers the Excellency and Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Holineſs; it doth at the ſame time manifeſt the reaſon, why God, who is a holy God, doth incourage the one by ſuch glorious promiſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us from the other by ſuch amazing threats; for whether we conſider him in himſelf, the purity of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes him love goodneſs, and hate vice; and how contemptible were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his love or hate, if happineſs be not the effect of one, and miſery of the other; or if you conſider him as the Governour of this world, it is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with his Majeſty to ſuffer the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Laws, without puniſhing the bold Offender.</p>
                  <p>So that now there's nothing further neceſſary to work this perſwaſion in us, but that 1. We ſhould be perſwaded that neither our <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>evil actions</hi> can be <hi>conceal'd</hi> from him: And 2. That he is arm'd with <hi>ſufficient power</hi> to bleſs and reward the righteous, and avenge
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42889:94"/>
himſelf of the ſinner; and both theſe Truths we learn from his infinite Knowledge, and infinite Power, both which we are abundantly taught in the Goſpel of Chriſt to belong to God: <hi>God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things: Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul, but rather fear him which is able to deſtroy both ſoul and body in hell,</hi> Mat. 10.28. And this God, thus <hi>knowing,</hi> and thus <hi>powerful, without any reſpect of perſons, judgeth according to every mans work,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17.</p>
                  <p>All this now amounts to thus much, that Vertue and Vice are not <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things,</hi> but that the one is moſt <hi>lovely</hi> the other moſt <hi>loathſom</hi> to God; therefore the one is moſt <hi>fatal,</hi> and the other moſt <hi>benificial</hi> to its Votaries; for there is an infinitely glorious Being who is moſt deeply <hi>concern'd,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way <hi>able</hi> to poure forth bleſſings on the righteous, and vengeance on the ſinner.</p>

Mortification (in him ſelf denial) is above all the Romantick gallantry of ambitious ſpirits; That to <hi>be Good</hi> is ſomewhat more noble than to be <hi>Great,</hi> to <hi>deſpise</hi> the world is more than to <hi>conquer</hi> it; to ſubdue the fleſh, a richer happyneſs than to be able to careſs it with all the flatteries of Luxury and greatneſs; and to <hi>know God</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> his <hi>will</hi> a greater honour and happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than to command the Lives and fortunes of Mankind; — How can this conſideration chuſe but beget in the minds of men, a ſtrange <hi>veneration</hi> for Religon, and a Love of Holyneſs, why ſhould we with a prepoſtrous ambition, affect thoſe fooleries of the world, and neglect true honor and happineſs, true greatneſs &amp; perfection! tho we our ſelvs ſhould not be able to diſcover it, yet we may very reaſonably collect both the beauty and neceſſity of Holyneſs, from the <hi>value</hi> an infinitly wiſe God hath of it which he doth ſufficently expreſs in labouring the reformation of the world with ſo much earneſtneſs; in imploying ſo much care and ſo much wiſdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; in makeing uſe of ſo glorious
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42889:96"/>
an inſtrument as his own Son, the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Fathers Image, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The works of nature and providence toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that light he ſhed upon our nature (being ſufficient to work in us a natural Religion,) had left our diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience inexcuſable; when he added ſo many other miraculous manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his <hi>glory</hi> and his <hi>will,</hi> and the inſtruction of Prophets, (authoriz'd by Miracles and foreknowledge of things to come,) all this muſt needs render <hi>them</hi> to whom it was addreſs'd much more inexcuſable; and what ſhall we think of our ſelves to whom he hath, in the diſpenſation of the fullneſs of time, ſent Jeſus Chriſt, declared to be the Son of God <hi>by Power, by the ſpirit of Holineſs,</hi> by the <hi>Reſurrection from the Dead?</hi> God might well expect, as the Lord in the Parable, <hi>Surely they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence my Son:</hi> The greatneſs of his Perſon is very fit to beget an Awe and Belief too; therefore as the Grace is greater, ſo muſt the puniſhment of its rejection: This is the concluſion S. <hi>Paul</hi> draws from the Divinity of his Perſon, prov'd in the firſt Chapt. to the <hi>Heb.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42889:96"/>
Therefore we ought to give the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip; for if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, And every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience receiv'd a juſt recompence of reward, how ſhall we eſcape, if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſo great a Salvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>If we ſecondly conſider the Life of Jeſus, only <hi>as a great example of the moſt exalted Holineſs,</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, <hi>charity</hi> towards his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> towards himſelf, we ſhall not only find in it a clear light to direct us in the practice of vertue, but alſo powerful motives to ingage us to it; for if our great <hi>Lord and Maſter,</hi> the Son of God, did thus deny himſelf, and renounce the world, what kind of Humility and Mortification will become <hi>us</hi> who are ſo far beneath him, and in whom are ſuch violent propenſions to ſin? how will it become us to walk; who profeſs our ſelves the Diſciples of ſo holy and ſo excellent a Maſter! we cannot be
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42889:97"/>
his Diſciples, unleſs we walk as he walk'd; for this was it he aim'd at to ſet us an example, and the thing we are to learn of him is his Holineſs: <hi>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye ſhall find reſt to your ſouls: He that ſaith he abides in him, ought himſelf alſo to walk ſo, even as he walked.</hi> All which imports a neceſſity of our imitation of him, and implies our ſtraying from his example, to be an interpretative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of our Diſcipleſhip.— Secondly, In the example of his Life, we may diſcern the <hi>Beauty</hi> and the <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> of a Holy Life; how lovely, how great, how Majeſtick was that Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Innocence which ſhin'd in him; and as a conſequence of this Holineſs, with what ſerenity and calmneſs of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections did he enjoy himſelf? with what aſſurance of mind did he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter all afflictions, and look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards another life? theſe are pleaſures which all muſt needs value who can underſtand them, and all may enjoy them who will lead godly lives.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42889:97"/>
Thirdly, from him we learn how <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> a thing it is, to prefer all the hardſhips which accompany Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to the vanities of this world, ſince he who was beſt acquainted with the happineſs of another life, and could have commanded all the advantages of this, deſpis'd all the flattering pleaſures of this life, and choſe the Croſs, and the afflictions of Righteouſneſs, that he might obtain an Everlaſting Crown: Let us chuſe as he did, and we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be miſtaken; nor let us be frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd at any difficulty, the <hi>ſame Spirit</hi> which ſtrengthen'd him, ſhall make us too Conquerours; nor can the World menace us with any thing worſe than what he endur'd, <hi>Want,</hi> and <hi>Scorn,</hi> and <hi>Travel,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> a ſhameful and a painful death, — which is that which conſtitutes the</p>
                  <p>Second part of the Hiſtory of our Saviour, and is a very paſſionate invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Holineſs, conſidered either as an <hi>Expiatian of our ſins,</hi> or as an act of <hi>his obedience to God;</hi> as an Expiation, it muſt 1. Plainly convince the world of the fatal deadly nature of ſin; for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42889:98"/>
when I ſee the Son of God ſtrugling with the torments of the Croſs, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the pain of his Wounds, pale and gaſtly breathing forth his Soul in the agonies of Death, I cannot think that the <hi>goodneſs</hi> as well as <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the Divine Nature could have thought fit for ſin to have been atton'd by ſo bitter a Sacrifice, unleſs the weight and horrour of it had call'd for ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation; and ſhall I play and fool with ſin as a harmleſs thing, when its guilt can't be cleans'd but by the Blood of the Son of God? Surely the greatneſs of the Sacrifice was intended to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to mankind the fatal nature of ſin the blood of Bulls and of Goats puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the fleſh indeed, but to purge the Conſcience another kind of Sacrifice was needful, even the Blood of the Son of God: I can eaſily read in theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of my Saviour, that the wages of ſin is death, and ſin is not grown leſs ugly, or leſs hateful to God, ſince the Death of his Son; <hi>before, the ſtrength of (i. e.</hi> that which gives the fatality to) <hi>ſin, was the Law,</hi> but now much more the Goſpel; I mean not as the one was
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42889:98"/>
a Covenant of Works, and the other is of Grace, but as the one, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Law had the Majeſty of God ſtamp'd upon it, and ſo each tranſgreſſion was an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to the Divine Glory; this other, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Goſpel arms its Laws with a double Obligation of infinite Glory and inexpreſſible goodneſs, ſo that the death of the Son of God doth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly enhance the guilt and aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, <hi>and makes ſin become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinful.</hi>— For 2. To <hi>lay down his life thus for our ſakes,</hi> to expiate our ſins by his blood, was an act of ſuch amazing love, as ſhould tranſport us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a chearful and ready obedience; <hi>The love of Chriſt ſhould conſtrain us, to live not to our ſelves, but to him who died for us, and roſe again:</hi> That the belief of his bitter paſſion for our ſakes, ſhould beget in us no tenderneſs nor affection towards him at all, is unnatural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, or that we ſhould <hi>love</hi> him, and not <hi>obey</hi> him, is as unnatural; but that we ſhould be ſo far from loving him, that we ſhould hate and perſecute him, is a baſeneſs I want words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs; and yet not only Apoſtacy, but
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42889:99"/>
any courſe of ſin doth crucifie him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, and put him to an open ſhame; for whoever is an Enemy to Holineſs and Goodneſs, is ſo to him too.</p>
                  <p>If we look upon his Death as an <hi>Act of Obedience to his God,</hi> then we learn from it the indiſpenſable neceſſity of parting with life it ſelf for the ſake of thoſe truths we profeſs; that nothing ought to be ſo dear to us as obedience to God: — We learn the great Leſſon of Mortification, call'd in Scripture, <hi>being crucified with him, made conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Death,</hi> in the ſubduing all our carnal affections, it being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unreaſonable that we ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an entrance into Glory by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther path than that of ſuffering, and unreaſonable to expect a ſhare in the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> to Glory, if we do not firſt <hi>die</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His Glory is the third and laſt part of our Saviours Hiſtory, which is a powerful inducement to Holineſs; this begins in his Reſurrection: Now the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the Dead, is a very clear proof of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> argues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42889:99"/>
and ſo the great Argument to a good Life, <hi>i.e.</hi> a Reſurrection, being demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to the very ſenſes of Mankind, leaves no excuſe for ſin; the wicked cannot flatter their Conſciences into confidence, by denying it, nor can the hopes of good men droop and languiſh thorough doubting of it: No, if Chriſt be riſen, then there is a Reſurrection from the Dead, and the ſame power which rais'd him, will raiſe us too at his coming; and they who have done well ſhall enter into that glory which Chriſt now enjoys at the right hand of God, as a reward of his obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. and all who imitate his Life, ſhall in their ſeveral degrees and proportions partake of a reward of the ſame nature; for <hi>we ſhall reign with him, we ſhall ſit with him in his Throne:</hi> And ſurely this example of the reward of goodneſs cannot but commit a kind of pleaſing violence upon the affections of man, and tranſport him above temptations; this was that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which raviſh'd the firſt Martyr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Extaſie, though on the brink of dangers and death, Act. 7.56. <hi>Behold I
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42889:100"/>
ſee the Heavens open'd, and the Son of Man ſtanding on the right hand of God:</hi> And if we could often lift up our eyes, and faſten them upon this pleaſing ſight, it would unavoidably raiſe us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this preſent world; we ſhould not be diſcourag'd at the <hi>poverty</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> of our Saviours Life, at the <hi>pain</hi> or the <hi>anguiſh</hi> of his death, if we did but often contemplate the <hi>peace,</hi> and the <hi>glory,</hi> and the <hi>happineſs</hi> which now Crowns his Conqueſts. It is very true, that a life led in <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and an <hi>Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> from ſenſual pleaſures, doth not appear very gaudy or taking to a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man; but if the ſame man could but behold one who had liv'd thus tranſlated into Heaven, how would he adore the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of the Saints! and how devout and holy, how pure and mortified would be his life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards! It is ſaid of the Diſciples who ſaw our Saviour carried up into Heaven, that <hi>they return'd to</hi> Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>with great joy, and were continually in the Temple praiſing and bleſſing God;</hi> a clear proof, that there would be no
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42889:100"/>
painfulneſs in the <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>fervency</hi> of a ſpiritual life, if we did often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the joys ſuch a life prepares us for; there would be nothing harſh, unpleaſant or diſhonorable in the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty</hi> and <hi>mortification</hi> of a Chriſtian ſtate, if we did but look forward to the Crown and Kingdom it doth gain for us; who that had ſeen our Bleſſed Lord received up with glory into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, would not have wiſh'd it had been his turn too, that he had <hi>liv'd</hi> and <hi>died, ſuffer'd</hi> and <hi>conquer'd</hi> with him, and had been to aſcend with him, out of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome ſinful World, with joy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And thus now it evidently appears, that every part of our Saviours Hiſtory is full of very powerful Motives to Holineſs; that all he did and ſuffer'd, tended <hi>to deſtroy the works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> and to implant goodneſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the world; and we muſt not think that a Deſign carried on by God in ſuch a wonderful manner, can be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than ſtrangely dear to him; and that we muſt not think, that if we through our obſtinacy and unnatural
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42889:101"/>
diſobedience defeat this Deſign, we can ever eſcape utter Damnation, a Damnation more <hi>unſufferable</hi> than that of ſinful <hi>Heathens, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore</p>

                  <p>IN 1 <hi>Ep. Jo.</hi> 1. this is ſet down as the great Meſſage which Chriſt came to acquaint the world with, that <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all;</hi>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:42889:103"/>
and therefore they who walk in the light have fellowſhip with him, and they that walk in darkneſs have none; where it is plain, that S. <hi>John</hi> founded the neceſſity of Holineſs in the Divine Nature; becauſe God is holy, therefore he muſt firſt renounce his own Nature, e're he can eſtabliſh any other (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) Laws, or love or hate on any other condition, than Holineſs and ſin: This being ſo, I think the beſt way to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Nature of Vertue and Vice, is to conſider how the one renders us like God, and the other unlike him.</p>
                  <p>The Account we have of the Nature of God is, that he is a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Eternal Life, Infinite Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> theſe are the chief of his Attributes, and ſuch as Reaſon it ſelf acknowledges to be the higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and excellencies imaginable: If Holineſs therefore tend to implant and improve ſome reſemblances of them in men, and Vice to efface and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them, it will eaſily appear, how the one makes us like God, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlike him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1, God <hi>is a Spirit;</hi> it is true, that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42889:103"/>
Vertue and Vice do not change the ſubſtances of things, and make Spirit Fleſh, or Fleſh Spirit; yet becauſe they do ſo wonderfully transform things, by inſtilling new qualities, and ſo altering the operations of beings, they are in Scripture ſaid to do ſo: Thus becauſe Vertue raiſes and refines the Soul, frees it from thoſe Fogs which a ſenſual do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage caſts about it, ſcatters a new light upon it, and mortifies thoſe affections which reign in the body, and render it more obedient to the mind; ſo that the man lives the life of Faith, as becomes a wiſe and an immortal being, therefore it is ſaid in the Language of the Holy Ghoſt, to have render'd him a <hi>ſpiritual man:</hi> and on the other ſide, becauſe ſin doth ſtupifie and ſenſualize the mind, imbolden and pamper the body, ſo that the ſoul ſeems to have chang'd its nature into fleſh, and reliſhes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thoſe pleaſures which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpiritual, but is wholly taken up with thoſe enjoyments which are the proper and natural entertainments of fleſh and blood, not a Spirit; therefore ſin is ſaid to have rendred the man a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Power</hi> is the third Attribute of God; Religion promotes even this in us, by inſpiring the mind with courage, and by the addition of ſtrength con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd to it; Innocence makes a man bold as a Lyon, it makes one dare and hope well, Religion is a confederacy with th' Almighty, and he becomes the good mans ſtrength, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 18.1. &amp; 19.4. it creates an awe and reverence for him amongſt men, and it makes him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach as near to ſelf-ſufficiency, as the

ſtate of a Creature will let him; he is independent on the world, and hath not half the hopes, nor fears, nor cares, that the wicked man hath; for this man hath an ill Conſcience, and is therefore timerous; he that fears not God, dreads every thing beſides; he hath many paſſions that are to be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and therefore he is very dependent on the world; he lives ill, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the ſcorn of Man, and the hate of God.</p>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42889:105"/>
no taſte or reliſh of thoſe glorious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of another world, and he lives as if he were in love with ruine; and though he ſee death, and confeſs it in the way, he is ſpurr'd on by his paſſions, and dares not ſhun it; he covets meer trifles vaniſhing fading pleaſures, meer apparitions and dreams of happineſs, and he flies from real and ſubſtantial delights and ſatisfactions that would never have an end; he trembles where no fear is, and yet is ſteeled and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs againſt Almighty Vengeance; and if this be not to be fooliſh, I know not what is?</p>
                  <p>The fifth and laſt now is Goodneſs, by which I mean kindneſs, and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to others; this Religion ſo far advances, that each man is ſo far Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian as he is thus good; this goodneſs or love is the meer ſubſtance of the Goſpel; ſo that where ever the Spirit of Chriſtianity hath planted it ſelf, the man is not only juſt, but good and kind, he doth not only put off re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and frowardneſs, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs, but he puts on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vertues, Meekneſs, Tenderneſs, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;

his goods and life are not too dear a price to pay for the welfare of a Brother; but ſin, on the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, arms man againſt another, and ſows nothing but diſſention and ruine amongſt mankind; injuſtice, cruelty, rapin, murther, covetouſneſs, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs, are the Characters which conſtitute a ſinner.

                  <p>Thus you ſee how Vertue and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs perfect and exalt the man, how it makes him more ſpiritual, gives him power, life, wiſdom, goodneſs, allies him to the Angels, and makes him like God, but ſin defaces all thoſe Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, makes him a meer heap of Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh and Ruines, a ſilly empty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Spirit might well ſay of ſuch, Rev. 3.17. <hi>That they are wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked:</hi> And who can now look upon ſin as a little harmleſs indifferent thing?

and fooliſh, and yet ſhall I ſtill go on to dote? Is it ſo little deſirable to be like God? Is it ſo inconſiderable a change, like the unhappy Angels, to fall from light to darkneſs! forgive me, O my God, I now begin to ſee a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in my ſins, I ſee its poyſonous nature, and the mighty wounds it gives, and I will ſhun it hereafter more than Death and Ruine, more than the Sword, the Plague, or Famine; for I am well convinc'd that there is nothing ſo excellent as Spiritual Life, Peace, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can wound or blaſt theſe, but ſin.</p>
                  <p>And if ſecondly, Life and Goodneſs, Power and Wiſdom are ſuch excellent things, how dear muſt they be to God? and how contradictory to his Will muſt be all thoſe Methods which men take to deface them? and this he hath ſufficiently taught, in that he hath thought it worthy the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Life and Paſſion of his own Son, to root out and baniſh iniquity and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from the Earth, being things contradictory to his Nature, and to his Deſign too in the Creation.</p>

                  <p>Our bleſſed Saviour after he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd upon the Mount a Syſtem of the moſt refin'd Precepts of Devotion and Purity, Mortification and Charity, as if he had foreſeen, that his Hearers would be dazled by the <hi>brightneſs</hi> of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Image, and look upon the Pattern as too high for the attainments of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature,</hi> doth cloſe the diſcourſe, firſt, with an aſſurance of a <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſiſtance</hi> of the Spirit of God: And then ſecondly, with aſſerting the neceſſity of a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>actual conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of our lives to thoſe holy Precepts, <hi>Matth</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>As to thoſe <hi>inſtances</hi> of enjoyments which are forbidden, the caſe is plain; all <hi>unnatural</hi> luſts are a Species of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (if they may deſerve that name) utterly interdicted the Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>As to our <hi>degrees</hi> of enjoyment, in all the inſtances of pleaſure which are allowed us, (and ſuch are all our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral appetites) it is firſt plain, that all
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42889:116"/>
kind of <hi>exceſs</hi> is forbidden us; and in this ſenſe the Precepts of the Goſpel are generally to be underſtood; the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy we are to mortifie is deſcrib'd to have ſuch members as theſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Fornication, uncleanneſs,</hi> (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve too an unnaturalneſs in them) <hi>inordinate affection, evil concupiſcence, and covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry;</hi>— and to walk after the way of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> or according to the world, is <hi>to have our converſation in laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, luſts, exceſs of Wine revellings, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetings,</hi> which is call'd afterwards <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Riot,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3, 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not to be queſtion'd but that the great deſign of Religion, is to raiſe our hearts upwards, to make us ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally minded; and therefore all Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which is contrary to this, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Analogy of the Goſpel; and by conſequence, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that an <hi>immoderate love</hi> of any thing, though an allowed inſtance of pleaſure, is contrary to the Goſpel of our Lord; accordingly I find, that that enjoyment of this preſent life which it permits to us, is ſuch a one as
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42889:116"/>
is <hi>cool</hi> and <hi>moderate,</hi> not <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>paſſionate:</hi> 1 Cor. 7.29. <hi>But this I ſay Brethren, the time is ſhort; it remains, that both they that have Wives, be as though they had none, and they that weep, as though they wept not, and they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyc'd not, and they that buy, as though they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd not, and they that are of this world, as not abuſing it, for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi>— And now thirdly by conſequence, whatever tends to the betraying of us into <hi>exceſs</hi> or <hi>dotage,</hi> is unlawful, conſider'd purely as the means to ſuch an end. From hence we may learn, how little injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religion is to mens preſent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; we are allowed all things but <hi>dotage, unnatural luſts,</hi> and <hi>exceſs,</hi> and all theſe are contradictory to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent happineſs; as for <hi>exceſs, and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> luſt, there's no queſtion; as for <hi>dotage,</hi> whoever ſhall conſider the emptineſs and uncertainty of this world, muſt needs conclude, that the greateſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our pleaſure is a moderate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and bating now all theſe, the Goſpel of Chriſt is ſo far from injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42889:117"/>
us miſery and trouble, that we are expreſly invited to it, by this Motive amongſt others, that <hi>it hath the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this life, as well as that which is to come;</hi> and we are permitted to look upon <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>proſperity</hi> as great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and we are allowed the delight of <hi>Friendly Converſation,</hi> love without hypocriſie, and to love our Wives e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as our ſelves.</p>
               <p>So that whatever is neceſſary to make our lives comfortable, is not only permitted, but promiſed us; but if we would make this <hi>Earth</hi> our <hi>Heaven,</hi> 'tis this, that is to be Senſual and Carnal; it is eaſie to apply theſe Rules to our Cloathing, Eating, Drinking, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they will make us wiſe and prudent Chriſtians, and Religion will appear pleaſant and delightful.</p>
               <p>There is one more limit affix'd to our enjoyments, and that is by <hi>Charity;</hi> we muſt take care our ſatisfactions, by our examples, do not betray or tempt others; Brotherly affection is not very hot in his breaſt, who rather than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf any little liberty, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the damnation of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:42889:117"/>2. The Remedies againſt pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>looſe</hi> and a <hi>diſſolute</hi> ſpirit, a gay and inconſiderate temper, is that which commonly betrays us into exceſs and vanity, into ſoftneſs and dotage; and therefore Religion endeavours to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs our ſouls with <hi>ſobriety</hi> and <hi>awe,</hi> by the <hi>preſence</hi> of a <hi>holy God,</hi> by the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> by the <hi>value</hi> and <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of our ſouls, and the manifold <hi>dangers</hi> and <hi>enemies</hi> they are <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd</hi> by; and therefore ingages us to paſs the time of our ſojourning in fear, to walk circumſpectly, to be upon our guard, and watch always.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the body is apt to grow wanton, it preſcribes us <hi>watchings, faſts,</hi> and frequent <hi>prayers,</hi> as the great inſtruments that do moſt tame and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie it, and at the ſame time improve and exalt the mind.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, that I may at once conquer my pleaſures, and live plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly too, I have drawn theſe other Rules from Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I never frame to my ſelf <hi>rich I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>'s, nor fancy I know not what Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in any object, but am content with
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42889:118"/>
an indifferent pleaſure, and hope for no more than what befits mankind in this ſtate on earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I train up my ſelf to <hi>endure hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by paſſing thorough ſome choſen diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, by checking even a lawful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by calling off my humour from too much freedom, and by accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my outward man to endure a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; and thus my temper grows ſtrong, and my mind ſtanch and firm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I obſerve that the Herd which aims at Senſual Pleaſure, either ſeldom meets it (and what a miſery is it to be damn'd for Luſts they never ſatisfied) or elſe they know not how to uſe it, or they are ſo ſoft and unmanly, they droop in every interval wherein they want it; and therefore I compoſe my ſelf on the quite contrary, to meet a Storm, and to ſtem the Tide, and to arrive at my Port through boyſtrous Seas; and ſo a ſmall blaſt doth not <hi>move</hi> me, a great one doth not <hi>ſink</hi> me, and a Calm, like an unexpected bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, is receiv'd the more <hi>thankfully,</hi> and us'd the more <hi>moderately.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:42889:118"/>4. I labour that my Converſation may be above, and I endeavour to look beyond this dark Horizon, and expect the breaking forth of the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: Sometimes in my Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation I die, and ſtrip my ſelf of all, and bid farewel to my deareſt friends, and my fancy wraps my body in its winding ſheet, and wafts my Soul to God, and I enter as far as I can into Heaven, and I dwell there; and ſo the taſte of another world, like the eating of <hi>Manna,</hi> makes my Palat too nice for the Garlick and Onyons of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The great Motives of the Goſpel whereby we are incourag'd to deſpiſe worldly pleaſures, are—</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Love of God,</hi> manifeſted in his loving us, and in the ſending his own Son into the world for our ſakes, that we might be the Sons of God: whence the Apoſtles every where infer, <hi>That the love of God ſhould conſtrain us to obey him,</hi> as dear Children, and Sons of the moſt High God; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, not to walk as thoſe who know not God, in the luſts of the fleſh, and the faſhions of the world; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42889:119"/>
renewed in the ſpirit of our minds, to pleaſe him in holineſs and purity— and the inexpreſſible <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus</hi> dying for us on the Croſs, will not ſuffer us to be guilty of ſuch a baſeneſs, as to betray him at the ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Senſual Luſt? and that <hi>bleſſed Spirit</hi> of Love which dwells in the Children of Obedience, is quench'd and griev'd by carnal luſts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt deny all impurity, that the Lord may delight to live amongſt them. Nothing will ſeem difficult to us, if we but conſider theſe things, the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of God, and the <hi>vanity</hi> of man, the <hi>height</hi> of his love, and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection</hi> of mans obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our <hi>own Exeellency.</hi> We are the <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> we are the <hi>Children</hi> of the living <hi>God,</hi> the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>Delight</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>care</hi> of <hi>Angels;</hi> and ſhall we wallow in bruitiſh luſts, like thoſe who have no <hi>knowledge,</hi> no hopes?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our <hi>rewards here, joy,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> do conſtantly dwell in that Soul which works Righteouſneſs, and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42889:119"/>
continues in patience and well doing; and can any of the fulſom pleaſures of the body be compar'd to the calm and tranſport of a holy Soul? and yet theſe are but imperfect dawnings of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Day; there are things laid up for thoſe who love God, which the heart cannot conceive, nor the tongue expreſs; and theſe precious promiſes muſt needs inable us to live above the corruption which is in the world through luſt.—</p>
               <p>So that now, though the pleaſures which Chriſtians are commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce were very <hi>full</hi> and <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> yet the love of God who injoyns this Abſtinence, the love of Jeſus who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for us, and the love of that Spirit which is tender'd in the Goſpel, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie our minds, and fill them with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure, would render our compliance with theſe Commands very <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>eaſie;</hi> and if we add the conſideration of the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> which flow from an entire Mortification, and the glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which are annex'd to it, it will be almoſt impoſſible to reſiſt the united
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42889:120"/>
force of ſuch powerful Arguments; and how much more if we conſider—</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>emptineſs</hi> and <hi>vanity</hi> of all thoſe pleaſures by which the ſinner is inſnar'd The world hath nothing in it which is truly great and ſatisfactory; its moſt exquiſite entertainments are ſtrangely <hi>empty, mixt,</hi> and <hi>alloy'd,</hi> and <hi>fleeting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Empty.</hi> Every mans practice is a daily confeſſion of this; for how ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſoever a pleaſure may appear in <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>proſpect,</hi> yet 'tis common, that men ſoon <hi>diſreliſh</hi> what they <hi>enjoy,</hi> and <hi>diſdain</hi> what they <hi>poſſeſs;</hi> and if men daily change and contrive <hi>new</hi> pleaſures, is it not a plain confeſſion of being diſſatisfied with the <hi>old?</hi> And what ſhall the poor Epicure do, if En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment it ſelf prove fatal, is it not an evident proof that the <hi>choice</hi> is fooliſh, the <hi>object</hi> empty, the <hi>faculties</hi> weak, and the <hi>world</hi> a Cheat? It were eaſie to prove this, if I ſhould run o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. What is <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> it is ſo much nothing, I know not what it is, it is a ſlippery height, it is a glorious ſlavery, a pretty Pageantry, and fantaſtick for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality: What is <hi>Wealth,</hi> this ſhould
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42889:120"/>
not be reckon'd as an enjoyment, 'tis but the <hi>mean</hi> to one; what is <hi>Luſt,</hi> but an outragious ferment of the blood, a ſudden mutiny of ſpirits; it is a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den blaze that flaſhes, and then dies; the delicacy and flavour of Meats and Drinks, is ſcarcely perceptible to moſt, it is ſo much nothing; <hi>gaity</hi> of attire is the pleaſure only of Children, and of Fools, it is an <hi>imaginary</hi> prettineſs.</p>
               <p>But the truth on't is, pleaſure here below is not to be meaſur'd by the weight and ſubſtance of the <hi>Objects,</hi> but by the quickneſs and ſtrength of <hi>Fancy,</hi> or <hi>Imagination;</hi> for 'tis with Men as 'tis with Children, 'tis not the <hi>rattle</hi> or the <hi>toy,</hi> but 'tis the ſillineſs of the fancy which creates the pleaſure; and therefore I'le conſider this a little: If the Imagination be childiſh, nice and fond, it frames and creates Art and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy in the object, and begets paſſions tender, impotent, and warm; poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion now (one would fancy) would certainly make one thus qualified hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; but the miſchief on't is, theſe are the characters only of a <hi>raw unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd</hi> ſinner, who admires what he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42889:121"/>
tryed; like a man come into a new world, the <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi> only begets the wonder; ſucceſs will make him unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: when he hath tryed all objects, he will find all but <hi>vanity;</hi> for as ſoon as Experience hath defeated him of the Imagination, it robs him of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure too, and a weather-beaten ſinner derives his temptation only at laſt from cuſtom, and he ſins not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis pleaſant, as becauſe he is us'd to do ſo: This is the whole ſtate of the caſe, Imagination and Fancy is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, not enjoyment; and <hi>that</hi> cannot laſt <hi>without this,</hi> nor <hi>with</hi> it: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is ſuch an uneaſineſs accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies a violent deſire of any thing that it more than puniſheth the pretty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which Fancy frames: hear a man eſſaying to diſcover what he feels, and he'll expreſs his paſſion by flames and feavers, wounds and diſeaſes, pleaſing ſmarts, and killing pleaſures, ſo <hi>ſick</hi> are they of their <hi>paſſions,</hi> and <hi>languiſh</hi> of their <hi>deſires,</hi> and <hi>die</hi> of <hi>enjoyment;</hi> 'tis in all pleaſures, as in thoſe of eating and drinking, the painful appetites of hunger and thirſt fore-run them, and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42889:121"/>
feeding and drinking extinguiſh the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite</hi> and <hi>pleaſure</hi> too! This is the caſe of thoſe who pretend to the greateſt <hi>gallantry</hi> and <hi>wit</hi> in the choice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of their ſins; what ſhall we think of thoſe who drudge for bafer metals, and more dreggy courſe vices: the toilſom pleaſures of gluttony and drunkenneſs, of pride and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the malicious pleaſures of fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, faction and diſobedience? Surely theſe are worſe than vanity: the Soul of man muſt be <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>airy</hi> and <hi>ſilly,</hi> and <hi>unballaſted,</hi> e're it can pleaſe it ſelf in the Imaginary Charms of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Command, and Beauty; but it muſt be <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>earthly, degenerous</hi> and <hi>ſottiſh,</hi> e're it can be taken by theſe. <hi>Emptineſs</hi> were enough to deter our purſuit; but beſides,</p>

part of his portion; for beſides the <hi>croſs accidents</hi> which befal things, and the <hi>inconſtancy of humours</hi> on which pleaſure depends, the ſinner himſelf lodges in his boſom a whole Legion of mutinous luſts, which (though the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the ſame parent,) do oppoſe and deſtroy one another; <hi>Love</hi> will not give way to the <hi>Intrigues</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue</hi> of buſie <hi>Ambition,</hi> nor <hi>Ambition</hi> ſtoop to the <hi>ſoftneſs</hi> and <hi>lazineſs</hi> of <hi>Love; Covetouſneſs</hi> will not admit of the <hi>waſte and prodigality</hi> of <hi>Luſt,</hi> nor <hi>Luſt</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the <hi>ſeverities,</hi> and <hi>ſtingyneſs,</hi> and <hi>drudgery</hi> of <hi>Covetouſneſs;</hi> a great Fortune's neceſſary to ſupport great ſins, and yet our ſins lay waſte our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: our health is neceſſary to ſenſual pleaſure, and yet our ſenſual pleaſures undermine our health: and thus the change of things and humours, and the contradiction of Luſts, makes the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners life a ſtrange mixture of <hi>Deſires</hi> and <hi>diſappointments,</hi> of <hi>purſuits</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentances;</hi> and after all, ſuppoſe the beſt we can.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our pleaſures are extreamly <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient; the faſhion of this world paſſeth
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42889:122"/>
away,</hi> every thing is in continual flux and change; and what pleaſes moſt commonly takes wing firſt; for the height and perfection of every thing conſiſts in ſuch a point, that Nature ſeems rather to be ſtill aſcending to it or declining from it, than ſtanding ſtill in it: But if the <hi>World</hi> were <hi>conſtant</hi> we <hi>ourſelves</hi> are not; our Temper day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alters, and our fancies are ſeldome the ſame to day which they were ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday; and how can our pleaſures be conſtant, when though their Objects continue <hi>Lovely</hi> we cannot promiſe our ſelves that we can <hi>love</hi> them <hi>long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may therefore thus ſtate our whole account, <hi>Time</hi> is but a moment to <hi>Eternity, Life</hi> but a moment in <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>enjoyment</hi> fills up but a very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Life:</hi> Lord what a trifle and <hi>nothing</hi> is <hi>that,</hi> which we prefer to an <hi>Eternity of Bliſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have conſider'd the Nature of the world (objects) to diſcover the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of pleaſure, it will be proper to conſider,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our <hi>own Nature</hi> who injoy: for this will give us further light into the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42889:123"/>
nature of ſenſual pleaſure! And here, 1. That Ray of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> which is ſhed upon the Soul, is a meer check and reſtraint to our ſenſualities; and renders the pleaſures of the Body <hi>in Man</hi> leſs pure and entire than in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Beaſts: and he that hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny greatneſs or wiſdom in his mind, ſins with the uneaſineſs that the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the Great feel, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to play the fool; they ſcorn their own eaſineſs and are aſham'd of their pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Fancies</hi> I have ſpoken to.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Senſes</hi> are narrow ſcanty things, they can enjoy but a <hi>little,</hi> and but for a <hi>moment;</hi> Let our fortune be wide and large as it will, our enjoyment can be no larger than our ſenſes; we may if we pleaſe ſtudy variety of Objects, but all the while we onely <hi>change</hi> often and <hi>poſſeſs</hi> but little, for ſuch is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our ſcanty Organs, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoy a <hi>new</hi> pleaſure without quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the old, <hi>i. e.</hi> Without loſing as much as we gain. Our change of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours is unaccountable, we are often ſullen and froward, and know not
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42889:123"/>
why; and then like children we quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with our toyes, and tear and throw away the bables which we doted on.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed God that ever rational men ſhould forfeit Heaven and incur a Hell for ſuch a mixt uncertain ſtate of emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pleaſures as this is! Could we like <hi>Moſes</hi> climb ſome Mountain, and arrive within Ken of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, and ſhame, and ſcorn, ſhould we look down upon the dull pleaſures of Earth! Well doth thy Holy Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Slaves of Sin, to be <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>ſleepy, dead</hi> and <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> things; for we need but open our eyes, and ſee through all that paint and varniſh that mocks and deludes the fancy; we need but be <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and we ſhall be <hi>holy</hi> too, for if we but once <hi>underſtand</hi> the world we cannot but <hi>deſpiſe</hi> it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The conſideration of what our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſures ſtands us in;</hi> they are too too dear a purchaſe without the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the life to come. They diſtemper and decay the <hi>Body;</hi> they exhauſt our <hi>Eſtates;</hi> and blaſt our <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations;</hi> they are the Furies which haunt and diſquiet us with <hi>deſires</hi> and

                  <hi>jealouſies, deſpight,</hi> and <hi>Anger,</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation,</hi> &amp;c. They diſſever the cloſſeſt Unions and the deareſt <hi>Friendſhips:</hi> They rob us of the more manly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of <hi>doing</hi> good; of being <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Learned;</hi> of a <hi>peaceful Conſcience;</hi> of a ſoul <hi>enlightned</hi> (like <hi>Moſes</hi> face) by a daily converſe with God; of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> grown ſprightly and chearful, through a cloſſer acquaintance with Heaven, and the conſcience of no guilt but what we have wept and prayed againſt: they bereave us laſtly of the ſatisfaction of a fixt and ſteady <hi>choiſe;</hi> of an aſſured and confident <hi>mind;</hi> of obſequious and governable <hi>tempers;</hi> of an even and orderly life; and of the joyes of glorious hopes and a growing aſſurance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And yet after all, if we ſtate the Caſe between the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad,</hi> as to point of worldly pleaſure (according to the natural iſſue or conſequence of things from their Cauſes) thoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs <hi>more</hi> and <hi>truer</hi> pleaſures tahn theſe; for whilſt the Good only <hi>approve,</hi> and the Bad dote, the Good <hi>uſe,</hi> and the Bad <hi>abuſe</hi> the World; the Good are

                  <hi>prudent</hi> in their choice, and <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>orderly</hi> in their deportment; the bad are <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>raſh</hi> in the former, and <hi>light</hi> and <hi>diſorderly</hi> in the latter; it muſt needs follow, that the Good are the <hi>Maſters</hi> of their pleaſures, the Bad the <hi>Slaves;</hi> that the Good meet with what they expect, becauſe they have true notions of the World and things of it; but the Bad are defeated in their hopes, becauſe they ſwell and enlarge their deſires beyond all poſſibility of receiving ſatisfaction from an empty Creature: that the ſtate of the Good, is as well ſecur'd and ſettled, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things below would admit; but that of the Wicked is confuſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Pain, conſider'd as a Temptation to Sin.</head>
               <p>BY Pain, I mean every thing which is troubleſome: All troubles may be reduc'd under two Heads, <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Real</hi> ones; by <hi>Real,</hi> I mean ſuch as do actually injure the mind or bodies of men; by <hi>Imaginary,</hi> I mean ſuch as could have no influence at all upon men, but through the aſſiſtance of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice or fancy. I'le begin with the latter; and in ſpeaking to both, I muſt premiſe this, that I will not bring home every Argument by a cloſe Application, (for then this very Head would ſwell into a vaſt proportion) but content my ſelf with proving, That there is no pain which can be a juſt warrant for ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Goſpel hath provided ſuch Remedies as may render it ſupportable, and ſuch Rewards as may countervail all our ſufferings: <hi>There is no Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which befals us, but what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42889:126"/>
to men, and God is faithful, and will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able,</hi> (the ſtrengths he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows us) <hi>but will with the Temptation, make a way to eſcape that we may be able to bear it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many things which are not really harſh and unſufferable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they become ſuch, becauſe it is the cuſtom of the world to think them ſo: For example, a <hi>ſhallow For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> (but ſufficient for the neceſſary comforts of life) an <hi>inglorious ſolitude</hi> or privacy, the <hi>Opinions</hi> of others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us; theſe things have no real influence, either upon mind or body; they cannot make the Soul leſs <hi>ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> nor the body leſs <hi>healthy;</hi> a man may be happy here, and go to Heaven afterwards without much fame or wealth; that all the miſery that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from theſe things, depends upon Opinion is plain, becauſe ſome have made that Poverty, retirement, and contempt their <hi>choice,</hi> which is ſuch a Bug-bear to others; and ſo the ſame thing, which is ones <hi>affliction,</hi> becomes anothers <hi>pleaſure:</hi> So that it is plain,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42889:126"/>
                  <hi>fancy</hi> gives us the wound, not the things themſelves; or elſe if miſery were an inſeparable Companion to the things themſelves, it were impoſſible that Content ſhould ever ſojourn in Cells or Cottages, or ever be a ſtranger to Wealth and Honour. Of this ſort of troubles are all thoſe other paſſions which are inkindled in us by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of things from without; for even <hi>Beauty, Grandure, Gaity, &amp;c.</hi> though in their own nature innocent things, are ſharpen'd and arm'd by our fancies with trouble and danger to our repoſe.—</p>
               <p>Now though it be true, that as the cold or heat of Climates are things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent enough to bodies inur'd to them, and yet are fatal to others; ſo here, though all temptations of the world are in themſelves harmleſs things, yet 'tis plain, that upon Beings ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpos'd and temper'd as <hi>ours</hi> are, they make dangerous impreſſions: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Goſpel of Chriſt, the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies preſcrib'd by him, do all tend to the removal of theſe ill diſpoſitions, and the reforming our falſe Opinions,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42889:127"/>
and the ſuppreſſing our inclinations: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our firſt care muſt be to frame <hi>our Opinions</hi> of things by the Rule of <hi>Faith,</hi> and to root out all falſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things; to this end the holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel doth every where inſinuate the <hi>emptineſs,</hi> the <hi>tranſitorineſs,</hi> the <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of all things here below; the <hi>Excellency</hi> of Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the little tendency which the things of the world have to promote it: And laſtly, the <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi> of happineſs in another world; all which contribute to our happineſs, as they arm us againſt the impreſſions of outward objects, by poſſeſſing us with a <hi>contempt</hi> of them, and with deſires far greater, and nobler, and contradictory to thoſe other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Goſpel of Chriſt injoyns us to ſhun and fly temptations all that we can; we are to block up all the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues by which the world may make its approaches, the luſtful muſt not gaze upon Beauty, nor the ambitious on greatneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and becauſe ſin uſually gains by Parley, we are carefully to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42889:127"/>
ſhun the leaſt appearance of evil,—not to entertain thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We are to labour earneſtly to mortifie all the luſts of the Body by Faſting, and Watching, and Prayer, and a conſtant temperance, incourag'd to it by the example of our Lord, and a whole Cloud of Witneſſes gone to Heaven before us, and the promiſe of rewards annexed to the careful perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of, and unwearied perſeverance in theſe duties. And</p>
               <p n="4">4. The aſſiſtance of the mighty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and a certain Victory is promis'd to him who thus contends; and unleſs men will willingly deprive themſelves of ſuch an Auxiliary by not contending, or not begging him of Chriſt, or grieving him, it is not to be doubted but we ſhall obtain him, and together with him ſufficient ſtrength, and glory, honour, and immortality, will be the end of our warfare.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Means, theſe are the Motives, this is the Aſſiſtance which our bleſſed Jeſus hath preſcribed and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd us, by which we may be inabled to live above thoſe miſeries which they
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42889:128"/>
are intangled in who obey not his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and defeat thoſe Airy Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which would fright us into ſin.</p>
               <p>Therefore in whatever condition I am I will ſtill ask, what would my bleſſed Saviour have done, or ſaid, or thought in this caſe? what opinion of, or value for this or that thing, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath God? and I ſhall ſoon find, that no condition can make me truly miſerable, but that wherein I cannot <hi>love God,</hi> I cannot <hi>pray,</hi> or cannot do <hi>good:</hi> For if I can, I am both great and happy: <hi>If a man love me,</hi> Joh. 14.23. <hi>my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> Happy abode! what can my Soul deſire more! I cannot think my ſelf <hi>mean,</hi> who am his <hi>Favorite;</hi> nor can I be <hi>poor,</hi> who poſſeſs that God whoſe preſence makes up Heaven! My God, how happy ſhould I be, could I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make thee alone my Portion; but becauſe I cannot be content to be <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>contemptible,</hi> becauſe I ſeek my comforts from without, becauſe I am not at leiſure to entertain thee only, therefore thou doſt not dwell ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhingly with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:42889:128"/>But I will ſeek thee more diligently hereafter, vain world adieu, I have Nobler hopes than thou canſt feed, and I ſhall have comforts thou canſt not rob me of! How can I be miſerable, if I be fill'd with joy and peace through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving? or if I abound with hope through the power of the Holy Ghoſt? I can think of that ſhine of Glory with which I ſhall be once inveſted, and then ſuffer theſe Rags with patience, till my Nuptials come, and my new Suits be made; I can love this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and poverty, becauſe it ſhall make my Crown more weighty, and my being more glorious.—</p>
               <p>What is it, O my Soul, for which I complain? what is it that I have loſt? Eſtate, Reputation. It is affirm'd by the Spirit of God concerning all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures in general, That <hi>they war againſt the Soul,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular concerning wealth, <hi>How hardly ſhall a rich man enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 19.23. concerning vain-glory, <hi>and how can they believe who receive the praiſe of men,</hi> &amp;c. Am I then ſo much troubled, becauſe my
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42889:129"/>
difficulties in the way to Heaven are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed? my Chains grown lighter, and mine Enemies fewer? becauſe my tyes to, or dependances on the world are few; and conſequently my diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in, and diverſions from holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are the fewer? I have no fears; no cares, no contrivances, no jealouſies, becauſe I have no concern in it? How near Heaven am I grown, who am thus remov'd from Earth? And being in this condition, I am not expos'd to the changes of the world, I have nothing wherein ill fortune can attacque or wound me? This ſtate is not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, which is thus full of peace, wherein I may poſſeſs my ſelf, and need not ſpend the greater portions of my life in things which <hi>fame</hi> or <hi>greatneſs</hi> requires of me, not <hi>inclination</hi> or <hi>choice.</hi>

                  <p>THere are ſome Evils ſo natural and conſtant Appendages to this ſtate of Mortality and Imperfection, that unleſs men can ceaſe to think them E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, they cannot be happy.

Now though it be true, that an Evil is not the leſs an Evil, becauſe it is <hi>incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> or <hi>unavoidable,</hi> or yet <hi>univerſal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt from hence infer, that the wiſe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42889:130"/>
man ought to be better provided and confirm'd againſt ſuch, and that he gains no ſmall ſtep towards happineſs, who can diveſt theſe Evils of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting ſhapes, which the man ſhall in a great meaſure do, who ſhall expect nothing more in this ſtate than what is proper to it; and then can no more be aggriev'd at Death, Chance, Folly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than at the imperfection of our intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual capacities, the meanneſs of our natural inclinations, and the frailties of our bodies, for thoſe other are the effects of theſe, and yet no man thinks himſelf miſerable, becauſe he doth not underſtand as much as God does; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being fleſh and blood, he doth not will as Nobly as Angels; and why ſhould he think it amiſs or hard, that being mortal, any thing ſhould die, or being imprudent or paſſionate, any thing ſhould act ſo?</p>
                  <p>It is highly reaſonable, that he who Created us out of nothing, ſhould Create us as he pleas'd; for he who was not bound to do any thing, cannot be blam'd for doing ſo much.— But Chriſtianity reſts not here, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42889:130"/>
a Remedy for all theſe Evils.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the diſcovery of the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, of the Bodies Reſurrection, and of glorious Rewards which ſhall Crown thoſe who ſuffer contentedly and patiently.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the diſcovery of Objects fitted for the affections of an Immortal Soul, noble and great enough to fill the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt capacities, and moſt inlarg'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; ſuch are God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and the glories of another life, which are unalterable and unchangeable; ſo that the happineſs and pleaſure of a Chriſtian Soul depends not upon theſe uncertain things below, but upon thoſe things which are above.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Since theſe misfortunes are ſuch as are unavoidable in this life, they can be no temptation to ſin, becauſe we cannot avoid them by ſinning; and they who endeavour to drown their ſenſe of worldly afflictions by an indulgence in any ſins, do worſe than thoſe who kill themſelves to get rid of ſome uneaſie paſſion; the very Remedy is the worſt of miſchiefs.</p>

common to, though not unavoidable in this life, I cannot chuſe but ſee there are a ſort of men who ſuffer <hi>bravely;</hi> and yet I muſt confeſs they <hi>ſuffer,</hi> and though they are patient, ceaſe not to be miſerable; theſe are the only things which I could ever think ſo unhappy as to deſerve my pity; and yet it will not be reaſonable to ſin for the avoiding ſuch ſufferings as theſe; for though Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot remove all ſenſe, and pain, and paſſion, (for then this world would be a Heaven; and the Scripture is plain, that no affliction for the preſent is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and if they were not Fiery Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, they would be no temptations,) yet it ſupplies all the eaſe and comfort which ſuch a ſtate is capable of, and ſuch as is enough to make it ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: Therefore I firſt premiſe theſe two Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That no temptation befals us, but what is common to men: That a whole Cloud of Witneſſes is gone before us in the ſevereſt and bloudieſt paths; and therefore that there is no ſtate which is not ſupportable by Divine Aſſiſtance, and may not be paſs'd thorough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42889:131"/>
ſuch an ill demeanour as may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit our everlaſting happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there is no condition ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, but it is capable of ſome mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of comforts; let us for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in matter of fact, regard the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of our Lord, 2 Cor. 6. <hi>In afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes, in ſtripes, in impriſonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in faſtings,</hi> and yet the Cloud had a bright as well as dark ſide; for <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Though dying, yet behold we live, though chaſten'd, yet not kill'd, though ſorrowful, yet alway rejoycing, though having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it matters not, I confeſs, as to entire happineſs, whether Scale of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or comfort outweighs, becauſe to entire happineſs it is requir'd, that both parts of us, as well Body as Soul, enjoy good; yet it will become a wiſe man to get as much eaſe as he can, and when the Sun is ſet, not to deſpiſe a Candle:—And this proves thus much, that no man can be neceſſitated to ſin, ſince a man can triumph o're ſuch affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:42889:132"/>Having premis'd thus much, I go on to conſider, that all Real Evils attack the <hi>Mind,</hi> or the <hi>Body;</hi> for what aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults only Reputation, or Eſtate, or other Poſſeſſions, I reckon amongſt <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary Evils;</hi> and indeed they are none at all, unleſs they make their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage thorough theſe to the Mind or Body.— As to the Body, I know not how to preſcribe to it; what are Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to the Stone, or Rhetorick to the Gout? but herein,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either the pain is moderate, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite; if moderate, it is ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; if exquiſite, it cannot be laſting: we are ſomewhat beholden to the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and weakneſs of our Nature, for it in a great degree prevents our unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, a ſmall pain cannot make us miſerable, and a great one will not let us continue ſo, for it cruſhes it ſelf as well as us, by its own weight, and our Nature dies and droops under the pain which it cannot ſuffer; though for my part, I muſt confeſs, were it not for Chriſtianity, it would be but a poor comfort to me, that my pain is great enough to butcher me, and make an
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42889:132"/>
end of me in a moment, that thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which diſpers'd and ſtragling I could tolerably well encounter, having combin'd and united all their forces o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow me in a moment; for men do not uſually think themſelves happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not meet with miſeries which are too big for, and therefore not incident to their Nature; but miſerable, if they meet with all the utmoſt they are capable of bearing; yet through the aſſiſtance of Chriſtianity, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration becomes matter of much comfort, for by the Revelation of Life and Immortality, the ſtate of pain, by being momentany, is as much diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to us; and thoſe who knew no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, as the Red Sea to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the one only paſs'd tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough it, and the other periſh'd in it; and it is a mighty Obligation to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in Holineſs, maugre all the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pain and trouble, becauſe this pain is not worthy to be <hi>compar'd</hi> with the glory which ſhall be <hi>reveal'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the affliction be too big for our ſtrengths, we are reaſonably to expect ſupernatural recruits; for ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42889:133"/>
befals the good but by Divine Permiſſion, and in order to their good, I cannot ſee why, if God will have our lives a Martyrdom, we may not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect the aſſiſtance he allowed the Primitive Martyrs; for without it we cannot ſuffer as we ought to do, and conſequently it cannot tend to our good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I am to enquire, what the Soul can contribute towards making our bodily pain more eaſie, and our burden more light; That it can do ſomewhat, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from examples of fact, as was ſhew'd in the ſecond Premiſe. I'le take notice farther only of two ſorts of men as a proof of this truth (though I might urge a hundred examples of the power of the Mind, in ſuſtaining the pains of the Body) the ambitious and the covetous, men which daily impoſe upon themſelves cruelties which would make up a very formidable burden, if laid on by Providence.— A vain man for an empty name ſtarves in a Camp, lies on the ground till his poor limbs grow ſtiff and clayy, as the Earth their Bed; and after all charges through
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42889:133"/>
ſmoak and blood to meet his death, or comes off trailing a ſhatter'd Limb a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Field, and is content with praiſe, for the loſs of a Leg or Arm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The covetous man lives upon Eggs or Roots, cloaths himſelf with Sackcloth almoſt, deſpiſes Fame and Honour, Friendſhip and Pleaſure too, and all this that he may die rich; and if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe think themſelves miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I do not know why any other ſhould? Such is the ſtrength of Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or of Paſſion, why Faith and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot do as much, I cannot ſee, becauſe Reaſon is ſtronger than Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and Faith calls in the aids of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Paſſion to boot.— Let it be granted then, that the Mind can aſſiſt us ſomewhat in our ſufferings; and then let us enquire what Chriſtianity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes as Remedies againſt <hi>Pain,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to conquer it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It diſcovers to us the true end of all afflictions, Gods glory, and our happineſs, for aſſuring us that all things are governed by a wiſe, powerful, and gracious God, who doth not afflict the Children of men out of any pieviſh
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42889:134"/>
humour, it muſt needs follow, that his chaſtiſements muſt be deſign'd to excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ends and purpoſes; that all ſhall work together for the beſt to them who love God; and why ſhould we not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit willingly to the Conducts of a <hi>wiſe</hi> God? or why ſhould not we ſuffer that condition contentedly, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes moſt our <hi>own happineſs?</hi> Why ſhould we be diſſatisfied with a more boyſtrous wind which drives us more ſpeedily into our Port? If his glory be the main end, and that be as much or more promoted by our <hi>patience</hi> in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, as thankfulneſs in proſperity; and our own Sanctification no leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, is it not juſt matter of comfort rather than repining!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It promiſes a weight of infinite glory which theſe light afflictions work for us; ſo that that condition cannot be miſerable which is full of the moſt glorious hopes, and thoſe too at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtance, for this life is but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It calls us to the juſt conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our own Merits, and having diſplaid a Scheme of our own ſins, it
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42889:134"/>
afterwards aſſures us, that we are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd here, that we may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd hereafter: Both which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations beget in us Humility and Love, and both render all ſufferings eaſie; for as Pride makes every little diſgrace intolerable, and magnifies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very affront; ſo Humility changes the face of the whole, and repreſents the ſtate, as very anſwerable to our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, very reaſonable and juſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It propoſes us the examples of Gods deareſt Children, and of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeſus himſelf, and invites us to weigh their ſhame and glory, their ſorrows and their Crowns together; to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their patience, and the love of God, and ſo to ſtrive earneſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding their end.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It aſſures us of ſtrength in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our neceſſities, that God who looks on, and ſees the Combat, will ſupply us with force anſwerable to the danger; and then what matter how violent our afflictions are.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of all is; afflictions are into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, becauſe we our ſelves ſharpen their ſtings, and warm their poyſon;
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42889:135"/>
becauſe we neglect or ſlight our own ſtrengths, we do not reaſon, believe and pray: I ſhall thankfully bleſs God for my afflictions, if all the while I ſuffer I am waſhing off a ſin, and labouring for a Crown, and untwiſting my ſelf from the world, and dreſſing my Soul for Heaven; I will thank God, that he hath caſt me into a condition void of thoſe ſnares which ſoften and ſenſualize the mind; to become ſenſual is a worſe fate, than to be ſcorn'd, or poor, for that is a change of our very Humanity, and draws after it the contempt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; this is a change only of outward circumſtances, and is fear'd only by the vain and gay, and ſcorn'd by fools; for to be <hi>truly humble,</hi> is to be <hi>truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi> and to <hi>ſuffer Chriſtianly,</hi> is the infallible Character of a <hi>great mind.</hi> Lord, I know that I am here but a ſtranger and Pilgrim, and I will not propoſe to my ſelf reſt and luſhious pleaſures, I am now in a ſtate of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and I expect not my eaſe, and a Kingdom, till I have vanquiſh'd; I am the Servant of the Holy Jeſus, and I will take up my Croſs and follow him;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42889:135"/>
and if he calls me to walk upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I cannot believe that he will let me periſh.</p>
                  <p>I have in this diſcourſe of Pleaſure and Pain had an eye to two things, not only to ſhew, that there can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ground for a Temptation to Sin in either, but alſo to demonſtrate the Excellency of the Chriſtian Principles, by ſhewing how they ſerve to all the ends and neceſſities of this mortal life, to regulate our Pleaſures, and alleviate our Pains; for elſe it had been enough for me to have ſaid, that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to quit an <hi>Eternity</hi> of pleaſure for a <hi>moment</hi>'s; and that no pain can be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to that of Hell; and therefore, that no man can be ſeduced from his duty by either Pleaſure or Pain, if he do really believe the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The Evils which diſquiet the <hi>Minds</hi> of men (as far as concerns this Head of Pain) may be reduc'd to two.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Doubting or uncertainty, when we have no ſure knowledge of matters of the greateſt moment.</item>
                     <item>2. Amazement and fear proceeding from guilt, and the apprehenſion of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vengeance.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:42889:136"/>The firſt of theſe is now ſufficiently remov'd by the Goſpel of Chriſt, which hath brought Life and Immortality to Light, and diſcover'd all thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and important Truths which relate to our Eternal Welfare, and our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is herein founded upon Divine Revelation, for God bore witneſs to the Authors of this Goſpel by Miracles, and by his holy Spirit, by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt from the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch is the purity and excellency of this holy Doctrine, that no man who believes a God, can chuſe but ſee that an obedience to ſuch holy Precepts muſt be acceptable to him.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond proceeds from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of our ſins, and a dread of the Divine Nature, either of which if they drive man into deſpair, muſt neceſſarily plunge him into profaneneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, or into melancholly and madneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Goſpel hath remov'd both theſe Evils.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the glad tidings of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation thorough the Blood of Chriſt, whom he hath ſet forth to be a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42889:136"/>
for the ſins of all who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent, to deliver them who through fear of death were all their life time ſubject to bondage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By a clear Revelation of the goodneſs and mercifulneſs of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature which Courts our return, beſeeches us to be reconcil'd to him, and waits for an opportunity to ſhew Mercy: Whence the Goſpel Characters of him now, are that of a <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>God of Hope,</hi> the <hi>God of Comfort</hi> and <hi>Conſolation,</hi> and <hi>Mercies,</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> ſo that the minds of Chriſtians are fill'd with joy and peace in believing, and abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghoſt. From all which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that no man can have any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to ſin, from any rational ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, from any rational fears or doubts; for this diſcovery of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and this Death of Chriſt, invites men to Holineſs, by the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Divine Love, and their own intereſt: But of this I have treated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of ſome other particular ſorts of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</head>
               <p>THough theſe <hi>(Pain and Pleaſure)</hi> are the great Magazines from whence the Devil brings forth all his Arms and Temptations, yet there are ſome peculiar ways whereby he doth inſnare and intangle us; for he doth not aſſault us openly, unleſs he hath before corrupted the Guards: he deals with us as with <hi>Eve, Ye ſhall not ſurely die;</hi> for if he had told her plainly the fruit is fair and pleaſant, 'tis worth your while to die for't, certainly ſhe would have bid open defiance to him, and ſcorn'd the temptation. Thus he deals with us, he cheats and deludes us into vain hopes, and falſe preſumptions; we wound our ſelves to death, and yet flatter our ſelves with life; we forfeit our Innocence, and yet impudently promiſe our ſelves a Heaven.</p>
               <p>I will therefore conclude this Part
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42889:138"/>
with a particular Chapter concerning Temptations,— which are moſtly</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Infidelity.</hi> This is the general way the Devil takes to deſtroy the Souls of men, and to ſeduce them from their duty; for it will neceſſarily follow, that it is the moſt notorious folly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to oppoſe our inclinations, or to deny our ſelves any thing, if there be no reward for holy ſouls; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againſt this, we are exhorted to take up the Shield of Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. to poſſeſs our hearts with a firm belief of the truth of the Goſpel of Chriſt. For this Reaſon the Evangeliſts and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are ſo full and frequent in the proof of the Fundamentals of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as the Reſurrection; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of this one Propoſition; That Jeſus is the Son of God; proving it from his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Holineſs, and Wiſdom, and his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and from the deſcent of his Spirit upon his Followers in ſuch a publick manner; and I heartily wiſh that all that profeſs the Name of Chriſt would</p>
               <p n="1">1. Lay ſeriouſly to heart the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and evidence of theſe proofs, and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42889:138"/>
not perfunctorily paſs over all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Goſpel, which are written on purpoſe that we may believe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weighing them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they would examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what are the firſt Motives which prompt them to <hi>Infidelity; Do they not love darkneſs, becauſe their deeds are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil?</hi> and do they not rather wiſh the Goſpel falſe, than believe it ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they would not ſtifle their Reaſon, and refuſe Audience to thoſe Pleas the Goſpel offers in its own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, when they cannot anſwer them; do not think its enough to divert your Conſcience awhile from its clamours and importunity, but ſatisfie it, and do not reſt, till you bring ſtronger proofs againſt the truth of the Goſpel than thoſe are which Patronize it; for he that will eject a receiv'd truth out of its poſſeſſion, muſt do it by a greater force and clearneſs of Arguments, than thoſe are which eſtabliſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmly perſwaded of this that Jeſus is the Son of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will be hard for any temptation to get much ground upon your minds; and therefore it
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42889:139"/>
were well and wiſely done, every morning to repeat our Creed ſoberly, muſingly, and thoughtfully, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our ſelves in the belief of it.</p>
               <p>Sect. 2. <hi>Late Repentance.</hi> But why ſhould I reſolve to amend after this ſin, rather than before it? Are my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts too little, that I would add this to the ſcore before I ſtate them? Or hath my God and Saviour deſerv'd ſo little of me, that I think a ſhort life too much to be ſpent in his ſervice, though he ſhould give me a Heaven? or am I ſure that I ſhall have a keener appetite to Holineſs after I have taſted the luſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſin? or will ſin be the more eaſily put off, the more habitual it is grown? or do I hope to find God the more merciful, the more I provoke him? or if the ſin be now too ſweet, too taking to be rejected (which is in truth the reaſon) how do I know it will not be ſo always? or if my body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, how ſhall I know when it is <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>repentance,</hi> whether a change in my <hi>temper,</hi> or my <hi>mind?</hi> or how do I know that ſome other ſin will not grow up in its ſtead? not only Youth, but
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42889:139"/>
every quarter of our life hath ſome baits or other ripe, and in ſeaſon? and how know I what limits the Almighty hath prefixt to his patience? he cuts off ſome ſooner than ſome, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of one mans iniquities is finiſhed before anothers? or how know I that God will allow me more ſtrength, who make ſo ill an uſe of this? O let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our ſelves, and ſin no more, we are blind, and do not ſee our danger; the hazard we run of <hi>hardning</hi> our hearts, and <hi>forfeiting</hi> Gods Grace, and <hi>provoking</hi> his wrath, and <hi>being cut off</hi> in a moment, when we think not of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>It is a little ſin;</hi> he is a very ill Caſuiſt, who deliberating upon a temptation, forms that fooliſh diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mortal and Venial ſins, for he proceeds upon a ſuppoſition which is wholly falſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> that there are ſome ſins which do not interrupt the love of God; God cannot approve of ſin in the leaſt degree however: but if as ſome think, this Veniality or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donableneſs is not founded in the nature of the ſins themſelves, but in the good will and kindneſs of God; it
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42889:140"/>
will behove him who will act ſecurely, to prove that God hath any where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd that he will not be diſpleas'd with him for thoſe ſins which he hath nevertheleſs forbidden upon pain of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal wrath; or if this be nonſenſe, let him prove that God will not be angry with him for that very ſin he is about to commit. In few words, the true uſe of diſtinguiſhing ſins by the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of mortality or pardonableneſs, is not to direct men how to ſin ſafely, or how to chuſe what ſins they may commit, but to direct the man who hath committed them, concerning the nature and degrees of his repentance; for in plain terms, no ſin can be juſtly call'd little, which we deliberate and conſult about, ſin receiving its aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation not ſo much from the matter of the ſin it ſelf, as from the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of our <hi>paſſion,</hi> and the <hi>Excellency</hi> of that God whoſe Law it is a violation of; for though the inſtance of the ſin may be a little one, yet if we ſin as far as we think we ſafely may, it is a foul ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the <hi>baſeneſs</hi> of our temper, and the <hi>imperfection</hi> of our love; like
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42889:140"/>
                  <hi>Judas</hi> we betray our Saviour for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Piece; a ſmile, a word, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails more than the love and bounty of my Creator; and do we not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to periſh? if we will be ſo fooliſh to chuſe thus, why may not God be ſo juſt as to puniſh us?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſin is generally moſt <hi>fatal,</hi> which looks moſt <hi>Innocent;</hi> for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is never more apt to inſinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than when transform'd, he appears in a ſhape of <hi>Innocence:</hi> Let but a man allow himſelf the utmoſt liberty he thinks <hi>lawful,</hi> and he ſhall be ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traid into what's unlawful; and he that ſhall indulge himſelf in any little vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhall be ſhrewdly tempted into greater, beſides the ſtrange danger of growing ſenſual, and undiſcerning; and beſides that, the leaſt ſin, even in the ſenſe of thoſe who moſt favour the diſtinction, grows mortal by frequent Commiſſion.— Therefore in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this temptation, we are taught</p>
               <p n="1">1. To grow in Grace, and to go on to Perfection, as being a ſtate of the greateſt ſecurity; and this requires the moſt careful and circumſpect walking,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42889:141"/>
the moſt intire denial of our own wills and affections; all which is inconſiſtent with the admiſſion of the moſt Venial ſin; for how can it conſiſt with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love of God to chuſe to diſpleaſe him a little; what ever a little trifling injury may ſeem to an unconcern'd Spectator, yet if it paſs between two who mutually love, it will ſeem great to both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are exhorted to ſhun, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every ſin, but every appearance of it, not to dwell within the Confines or Suburbs of Temptations, not to act the leaſt thing which we but doubt may be unlawful; and therefore ſurely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we know, is not to diſpute nicely what we may without danger do, but to do all that is Noble and Praiſe-worthy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we have done all, we are but unprofitable ſervants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us, who I am confident ſhall never do all we ought, endeavour to do all we can; when we have watch'd, and when we have pray'd; when we have contended, and when we have fought, when we have done all we can,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42889:141"/>
there will be ſtill ſins enough to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the mercy and goodneſs of God; ſins ſecret which we know not of, ſins of ſudden ſurreptions, imperfections mixt with our holy duties, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable evil motions, which unleſs the Blood of Jeſus, our own Repentance, and the mercies of God intervene, would unavoidably damn us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. When theſe ways fail, he ſets upon us by other Engines; by our Friends; by ſome or other who have an Aſcendant over us; and it is not ſeldom ſeen, that the <hi>Friends</hi> of our Boſoms are the greateſt <hi>Enemies</hi> of our Souls: For the truth is, Friendſhip is the deareſt and moſt pleaſant thing in the world; whence it often happens, that men of the moſt excellent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and the moſt generous Principles, have been often induc'd by Friendſhip to do or ſuffer, what neither their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per pleaſure nor pain could ever have ingag'd them to; and in all honeſt and allowable inſtances, to prefer a Friend before our ſelves, is, if not a Duty, yet certainly an Heroick and commendable action. But here, as to our purpoſe in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42889:142"/>
hand, the caſe is thus to be ſtated, Whether I am to obey God or my Friend; whether I am to ſerve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of my own Soul, or comply with a Friends peccant humour, to the <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt hazard</hi> of my <hi>own Soul,</hi> and <hi>his.</hi> The caſe thus ſtated, is I think too plain to contain in it any doubt or Controverſie at all; for our Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, who hath more powerfully indear'd himſelf to us, ſupercedes all Obligations, in this caſe, to our Friend; nay, Friendſhip it ſelf obliges us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>advice</hi> and <hi>reproof,</hi> than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance; it being the true duty of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to do not what is moſt <hi>pleaſant,</hi> but moſt <hi>uſeful</hi> for our Friend: And I muſt ſay further, that Friendſhip is or ought to be founded in Vertue; and therefore without the guilt of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Inconſtancy, I may <hi>lawfully</hi> as far renounce my <hi>Friend,</hi> as he doth his <hi>Innocence;</hi> for he is become quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing, and hath nothing of that Charm and Grace which made me love him: In this caſe it is enough to anſwer, as our Saviour did to the Devil, Thus and thus 'tis written; it is not lawful
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42889:142"/>
for me to do ſo, and therefore I will not, for Vertue needs no excuſe; if <hi>they</hi> can act a Crime without bluſhing, I ſee no reaſon why I ſhould be aſham'd to own a Vertue; and if they think it unreaſonable that we ſhould deny them the liberty of enjoying themſelves, I think it much more ſo, that they ſhould refuſe us the liberty of denying our ſelves.— And this way of plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be every way more uſeful to your ſelf and Brother, than diſguizes and excuſes: For he that ſhifts off his Friends importunity to ſin, not by a flat <hi>denial,</hi> but a <hi>pretence,</hi> ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that he denies compliance, not out of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but convenience; and ſo expoſes himſelf to a freſh aſſault, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Friend looks upon him as Conquerable, and only waits for an opportunity wherein he may attack him in better circumſtances, and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter temper: all which would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by a plain and hearty refuſal. 2. This way, in common reaſon, muſt prove moſt uſeful to our Brother; for how do we know but the influence of our Friendſhip, by the aſſiſtance of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42889:143"/>
Gods Grace, may gain upon him, or open diſallowance may at leaſt ſtartle him into a ſerious conſideration, which will be enough to defeat him of his Folly; and the example of our Vertue may incourage his imitation, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him ſee that Vertue is <hi>eaſie</hi> as well as <hi>lovely.</hi> — Againſt all devices of Satan, and Temptations in general, I lay down theſe three or four Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That be the Excuſe or Impoſture as cunningly wove as it can, it matters not; be the Excuſe what it will, I am to conſider this, that by hearkening to ſuch devices of Satan, that Croud which now throngs Hell deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe horrible Regions; never any man yet ſinn'd with a deſign or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion to be damn'd for it, but he contriv'd his excuſe as ſubtilly, and provided a reſerve as ſafe as poſſibly he could, and yet they miſcarried; God cut them off ſuddenly, or ſin grew too ſtrong, and they too weak.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is eaſier to <hi>conquer</hi> a Luſt, than to ſatisfie it; the Ambitious may grow <hi>content</hi> ſooner than <hi>great;</hi> the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42889:143"/>
may ſooner <hi>moderate</hi> their deſires, than <hi>ſatisfie</hi> them; the Unclean may more eaſily <hi>gain a chaſt Spirit,</hi> than <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the ravings of a wandring Luſt; for a mans Frame grows tractable and governable by wholeſome Reaſonings, and ſound Advice; Heavenly, by Prayers and Meditations: But if you liſten to a wanton ſuggeſtion, it will kindle into Luſt; and Luſt, if incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd, will flame into a paſſion; and our paſſions will grow ſavage and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious, if fed and pamper'd, and then no greatneſs can glut ambition, no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments eat a Luſt: And ſhall we chuſe a harder way which leads to an Eternal ruine, before an eaſie way which guides us to happineſs?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ought heedfully to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that temptations do not gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any by ſtrength of Argument, but by importunity and prepoſſeſſion; no man that weighs the things temporal and eternal, can prefer in his judgment thoſe to theſe, but thoſe are ſeen, and theſe are not; thoſe are continually with us, and they carry their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Rhetorick in their looks,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42889:144"/>
and every ſenſe of us is conſtantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and applied; and ſo by inſenſible degrees they inſinuate, and then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs us, and captive us: The beſt way therefore to ſecure ourſelves, is either firſt to cut off all opportunities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempted by retirement, and retreat from the world; or ſecondly, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the world by an equal dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, making our Meditations and Prayers more frequent than our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of ſenſe; that ſo the Soul may be call'd off from the things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, to meditate upon the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; as often at leaſt as Gaity and Luxury invite it out.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As there are objects of vanity, ſo there are too in the world objects that adviſe and reprove us, ſuch as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and ſickneſs; that raiſe our thoughts, ſuch as the works of Gods hand, and all others are capable of a good obſervation; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, what is an evident vanity, may be the matter of our pity, rather than love; Feaſts and Muſick may ſuggeſt the Almighties goodneſs, and lead us to the conſideration of a better ſtate;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42889:144"/>
and if we uſe this method, we ſhall reap a double benefit; Firſt, We ſhall avoid the inſinuations to ſin viſible in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward objects; and ſecondly, We ſhall have our Souls ſtor'd with excellent thoughts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Never ſlacken nor abate thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, though thou have arriv'd at a great degree of Piety, and haſt morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the fleſh, and ſubdued the world, there is no ſecurity on this ſide Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; many good men fall, the beſt may; and <hi>therefore let him that ſtands, take heed leaſt he fall;</hi> for what will be the iſſue, God only knows. <hi>The Night is far ſpent, the Day is at hand;</hi> and wilt thou let go the Victory, when thou haſt broke the main ſtrength of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle? thou art almoſt above fears, and above ſtruglings; thy life haſtens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and thy task diminiſhes, and wilt thou ſhipwrack in the Port? Thou art juſt going into the Arms of thy Lord, and wilt thou now ſuffer thy Beauty to fade, and thy glories to languiſh?

Worſhip or Holineſs, contains in it theſe four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An humble acknowledgment of our ſins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A devout Profeſſion of our Faith in Chriſt, that we are the Diſciples of a Crucified Saviour, and expect Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by no other way, than that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his Body and Blood offer'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A ſolemn Oblation of moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hearty thanks to God for this ineſtimable benefit, his beſtowing his Son upon us to die for us: and to our Maſter and only Saviour Chriſt, for his exceeding great love in dying for us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A moſt ſolemn Oblation of our ſelves, ſouls and bodies, to be a holy, lively, and acceptable Sacrifice unto God: ſo that this Sacrament conſiſts of a whole Conſtellation of Graces, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Faith, Hope, Charity:</hi> It is a nearer approach into the preſence of God, and more ſolemn exerciſe of the Graces of the Goſpel: and this gives a very fair account of the reaſon of its frequent practice; for nothing can be</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A more effectual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42889:148"/>
of Holineſs, upon theſe, and the following accounts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the preparation neceſſary as a condition of our worthy Reception, doth awaken our Souls, and refreſh all our Graces, and mortifie all our ſenſual Luſts, and draws us nearer to Heaven; and the neceſſity of ſuch a preparation as the Church-office preſcribes, appears from hence, that Repentance, and Faith, and Charity, are abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inable a man to exert thoſe acts (before-mention'd) which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute this Sacrament, conſider'd as a part of Divine Worſhip; and therefore to approach that holy Table without a Soul ſo qualified, is to affront and mock the Majeſty of Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the exerciſe of our Graces in receiving, doth increaſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them; that act of humble <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and profound <hi>Proſtration</hi> of our ſelves before God, under a ſenſe of his Purity and Majeſty, and our ſinfulneſs and meanneſs; that lively Acts of <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby the Soul doth profeſs its firm belief of, and dependance upon the Death and Paſſion of its dear Lord and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42889:148"/>
Saviour for Salvation; that <hi>love</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Soul offers its praiſes, and its ſelf a Sacrifice to God, do leave ſuch lively and laſting impreſſions upon mens minds, as are not quickly nor eaſily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd; and the Soul by the delight it finds in its exerting theſe Graces, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled with a deſire of repeating the ſame Acts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Sacrament it ſelf hath a natural tendency to promote Holineſs: 1. By its ſenſible <hi>Repreſentations</hi> of a Crucified Saviour, the Symbols them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being fit to bring into our minds the pain and ſufferings of our dear Lord and Maſter. 2. By that <hi>inward Grace</hi> (inſeparable from the worthy Reception of it) beſtow'd upon us to refreſh and ſtrengthen our Souls, to root and confirm our Faith, to inflame our Love, and perfect our Hopes. 3. By being a <hi>Pledge and Aſſurance</hi> to us of the pardon of our ſins thorough the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That it is a new and repeated En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of our ſelves to the ſervice of Chriſt, to an obedience to his Laws, and a Renunciation of thoſe Enemies
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42889:149"/>
of the Chriſtian, the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi> From all this it is eaſie to infer;</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it is a ſtrong Fence and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt Temptations; for theſe freſh impreſſions of our Saviours love, the new ſtrengths of Divine Grace, the vigour of a new and ſolemn Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Obedience, fill the Soul with a holy zeal againſt ſin, and with a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious contempt of ſenſual pleaſures.</p>

                     <p>ANd now, O my God, what ſhould make me ſo prodigally venturous of my own ſafety, as to neglect the frequent uſe of this holy Sacrament! Have I not need frequently to examine my ſelf? Are not thy Graces apt to wither and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, unleſs thus water'd and refreſh'd? Doth not my converſe with the World, and my communication with Fleſh and Blood, render it neceſſary for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new my reſolutions againſt them as often as I can? or is there not a holy delight in the exerciſe of all this, that ſurpaſſes all the pleaſures of a ſenſual life? and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42889:149"/>
is it not a Sacrifice that my Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is highly pleas'd with? and is it not reaſonable that I ſhould oblige him who died for me with this frequent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his infinite love evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc'd in his death? Pardon me, O my God, that I have been ſo ungrateful to thee, ſo ſenſleſs of my own welfare and advantage! for the time to come, I will delight in this holy Communion, I will often offer up my ſelf a Sacrifice to thee, and profeſs my Faith in a Crucified Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and there beg thy aſſiſtance and conduct through the difficult paths of this preſent life: And, O my God, accept thou of my addreſſes and praiſes, thorough thine infinite Mercies, and the Blood of Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>PRayer may be conſider'd under thoſe three Heads I before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd: And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As a part of Holineſs.</hi> It is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of God's being our God; a <hi>confeſſion</hi> of his Majeſty, and our meanneſs, being a ſolemn <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:42889:150"/>
and <hi>Worſhip</hi> of him; 'tis a Sacrifice of <hi>praiſe</hi> to him; 'tis an act of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> and of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Reliance</hi> upon him: And from hence we may infer, what preparation of the Soul is neceſſary to a right diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this Duty; that <hi>extempore</hi> Addreſſes are the moſt improper, and the moſt unwelcom to God; for theſe are at beſt but imagin'd to raiſe thoſe paſſions or diſpoſitions in the Soul, which ought to be preſuppos'd in it before-hand, to the rendring of our Prayers acceptable; for we draw near in prayer, to offer up a Sacrifice which we had prepar'd before: And we may ſecondly conclude, that what ever the <hi>gifts</hi> of Prayer be, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer is that which doth diſpoſe and prepare the mind by ſuch qualities as are fit to exert the acts I nam'd before; and I am apt to think, that a Soul which thus prepar'd, and fixing it ſelf in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate preſence of God, dwells with an inward devotion upon thoſe acts of Adoration and Praiſe, Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Faith, without expreſſing theſe actings of the mind in words (I
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42889:150"/>
ſpeak of private prayer) doth in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. pray by the Spirit; and conſequently in publick thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are moſt ſpiritual, which ſhare moſt of this preparation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As an Inſtrument of Holineſs:</hi> it doth exerciſe all our graces, and refreſh and improve them by exerciſing; the breathings of the Divine Spirit (which is in an extraordinary manner aſſiſtant in this holy exerciſe) fill the minds of men with <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> which confirms them in their Chriſtian Warfare, and makes them diſreliſh all the pleaſures of a ſinful life. Laſtly, Prayer hath extraordinary promiſes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to it, of receiving whatſoever we ask with Faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It <hi>is an Antidote againſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for it poſſeſſes the Soul with an <hi>Awe</hi> of the Divine Majeſty, with a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of his unſpeakable <hi>love,</hi> and with a <hi>horrour</hi> againſt ſin, whilſt we enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his benefits, and our ſins, with all their aggravating circumſtances: And certainly no man can be ſo ſenſleſs as to repeat thoſe ſins which he did juſt now

bemoan and abhor, renounce and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve againſt before God; nor will it be eaſie for him to fall, who comes forth forewarn'd and arm'd to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Temptation. Laſtly, Prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces a man of the lovelineſs and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a holy life, for he finds that his peace and reliance grows up or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays together with his Vertue.</p>
                  <p>If I did pray earneſtly and often, how <hi>humble,</hi> how <hi>holy,</hi> how <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>exalted</hi> would my Soul be! with what glorious Notions of the Divine Majeſty, what dreadful apprehenſions of ſin, what an unquenchable thirſt of Holineſs, what fears and jealouſies of the World and Fleſh, would my Spirit be poſſeſs'd by! and what a mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence would all this have upon my Converſation! how humbly, how wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, how fervently ſhould I walk!</p>
                  <p>But when I do not pray often, or with this care and preparation, how <hi>lazy</hi> and <hi>careleſs</hi> is my life! how <hi>dim</hi> and <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> my conceptions! how <hi>ſtat</hi> and <hi>taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> my reliſh of ſpiritual things! how doth a worldly ſenſual temper grow and increaſe upon me, and the Divine Life within droop and languiſh.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Who ever ſhall conſider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of the devouteſt men, the Nature of this Body we are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with, or the frequent ſins to which the luſts of it have betraid us, will diſcern Reaſon enough to invite him to this Duty, either in order to our Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and our future ſecurity, or as an act of Affliction and Revenge for our paſt faults: Therefore</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Who ever totally neglects this Duty, upon pretence of the ill effects it hath upon either Body or Mind, ought

well to be aſſur'd, that the uneaſineſs of the one or other, be not the effect of a wanton and carnal Mind, rather than of the temper of the Body; and that his Body will admit of no degrees of this Duty, otherwiſe he is oblig'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his capacity.</p>

To Faſting muſt be joyn'd Alms and Prayer, and Vain-glory muſt be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it; without the former it is inſignificant, with the latter it is a ſin: But if any juſt Reaſons diſable any man to give Alms, or to devote the day intirely to Spiritual Exerciſe, I cannot yet think but that Faſting may be us'd as an act of Affliction, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it be conſecrated to God by a holy intention at leaſt.</p>

                  <p>I Am now earneſtly to beſeech the Reader, to reflect ſeriouſly upon this whole Diſcourſe; and conſider, whether the Chriſtian Religion be not a Syſtem of moſt <hi>glorious, delightful,</hi> and <hi>important</hi> Truths; whether any Principles can raiſe Man to ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <hi>Conqueſt</hi> o're the world, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? whether Holineſs doth not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him into a <hi>great</hi> and a <hi>glorious</hi> thing? whether any knowledge can create in him ſo perfect a <hi>peace,</hi> and ſo undiſturb'd a <hi>joy?</hi> whether there be any thing beſides Religion, can make a man ſpurn fawning <hi>pleaſures,</hi> and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brave his <hi>fears?</hi> whether there be any

thing which would turn the world into ſo much Paradiſe, and ſecure our <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>intereſt</hi> on ſuch unſhaken bottoms, and lead on the whole Train of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or a private life in ſuch a <hi>ſafe</hi> and <hi>pleaſant</hi> method. What then? Art thou fond of ruin! or hath damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any charm in it! that thou wilt ſtill reſolve to perſevere in ſuch a manifold contradiction to the Laws of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus! Wilt thou ſuffer thy ſoul to be miſerable here through thoſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous luſts, which are the inceſſant torments of it? and canſt thou think of abandoning all the hopes of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous immortality?</p>
                  <p>Or doſt thou indeed look upon the Goſpel of Chriſt, as cunningly deviſed <hi>Fables,</hi> and readeſt theſe kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings, as only wiſe and politique ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues? Surely ſo much Holineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by ſo many miracles, muſt needs witneſs its divine authority; and if thou wouldſt but trie thy ſelf the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it, thou wouldſt feel its <hi>divine</hi> principle, in the <hi>Life</hi> and the <hi>joyes</hi> of the Spirit!</p>
                  <p>But I am perſwaded, the greater part

of mankind, cannot chooſe, but inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of Inclination, acknowledge the <hi>truth</hi> of the Goſpel, and the <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of virtue; and confeſs that their vices are the effect, not of their <hi>choice</hi> but <hi>weakneſs!</hi> Bleſſed God!

him to allow them ſo much Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation as he would to any other thing which pretended to ſo much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and importance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If there be a God, Nature ſeems to dictate, that he is a Rewarder of thoſe that ſeek him; and forgets not the Wiſe and Virtuous, neither in Life nor Death (and <hi>Men,</hi> as wiſe and rational Creatures are his peculiar Off-ſpring, and more nearly related to him:) and on this Argument <hi>Socrates</hi> in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy founded his hopes of another life; an argument much of a kin to that of our Saviour, <hi>God is the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the God of Iſaac, the God of Jacob, now God is not the God of the dead, but of the living;</hi> at the ſmartneſs and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which arguing the people were aſtoniſh'd: And</p>
                  <p>If there be <hi>another Life; Virtue</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> muſt needs be the proper qualities to recommend and endear us to the God who preſides in that other World: (for I can never fancy a Bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and irrational Deity!)</p>
                  <p>If there be no God (which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (it is a thing impoſſible to be

prov'd; and therefore an Atheiſt can never poſſeſs his Soul in any Reſt and Peace; and beſides if there be none, the belief and practice of this Religion of Chriſtianity (as I'le make appear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently) can do no man any harm; and what madneſs then is it, not to take the ſafeſt ſide in a mat-ter of this dear concernment!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In behalf of Chriſtianity in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I beſeech ſuch a one to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
                  <p>That if thoſe Miracles and Proofs of Divine Authority, which the Goſpel relates were true and real, then the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is beyond diſpute.</p>
                  <p>If they were not I would fain ſee ſome probable account, how Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity could ſo generally obtain, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all the diſadvantages it was to encounter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> having neither <hi>intereſt,</hi> nor <hi>pleaſure,</hi> nor <hi>force</hi> to countenance it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the eſtabliſh'd <hi>Superſtitions</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> of the Age.</p>
                  <p>That it concern'd them of <hi>Judea,</hi> which was the Scene of our Saviours Actions, to have given the world a manifeſt account of the Impoſture, and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:42889:155"/>
ſo have provided for the ſecurity of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme, which was ſubverted by it; that the wiſeſt and moſt religious Sects amongſt both Jew and Gentile were quickly ſwallowed up into Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!</p>
                  <p>That thoſe early dayes were the moſt fit for a confutation of the Proofs on which Chriſtianity is bottom'd, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt nearly conjoyn'd to the times of our Saviours and his Apoſtles acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and therefore capable of being eaſily inform'd, and yet we find no ſuch thing done; which muſt needs ſuppoſe the world either monſtruouſly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or ſtupid, and ſenſeleſs not only of their ſecular but eternal intereſt: the former is utterly falſe, and the latter ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; therefore it is more than probable, no ſuch confutation could beform'd;</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Majeſty,</hi> the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Holyneſs,</hi> the <hi>Miſteries</hi> and <hi>Propheſies</hi> of it are ſo many tracks of Divine Glory, which beſpeak God its Author; it being very improbable, that e're the Devil ſhould be ſo ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, as to promote that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which is ſo contradictory to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:42889:156"/>
and tho he ſhould have blended it with ſpeculative errors, that cannot be thought a miſchief able to ſatisfie him for all the good it hath done in the world; nor would ſuch a deſign ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour enough of the malice of Hell, for ſurely God will never make a good man eternally miſerable, for a ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Error into which his <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Reſignation</hi> to God, and ſuch ſtrong probabilities (not to ſay more) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd him.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe (againſt all Reaſon) that it were Fictitious; what can any man ſuffer by the belief of theſe Principles; certainly they tend to make us like God, and there is no article which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects any diſparagement upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, but diſcovers it to the World, in the greateſt and the loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt characters; and therefore unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, if any Religion, than this, will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our future Life.</p>
                  <p>As to the preſent, if our Life be clouded and o'recaſt by afflictions, theſe Principles alone can ſupport us under them, becauſe theſe only are ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial grounds of courage or content:
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42889:156"/>
if our Life be calm and fair, no man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes it with a more conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubled ſatisfaction than the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for Religion only crowns our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperities with a firm peace and content within:</p>
                  <p>And yet all the clamour rais'd againſt Religion is this, that it enviouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenches upon the pleaſures of Nature, and wheadles us out of the poſſeſſion of preſent pleaſures by the deceitful promiſes of future—</p>
                  <p>In anſwer, I would fain know of any the moſt fortunate Epicure, (for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I have never been lucky enough to diſcover any ſuch ſtate) whether there be any enjoyment rich as <hi>Fancy</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing as <hi>Dotage,</hi> if there be, of what <hi>conſtancy</hi> and <hi>unmixt</hi> purity it is; for if it be not fixt and ſteady, then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, chearful Life, as free from unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie fears, deſires, and troubles, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentances, as from the taſte of ſuch luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Meals, is ſurely to be preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a few fortunate minutes, of a Life in the general disorder'd and troubl'd: or whether accounts being ſtated right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we may not ſafely conclude, that
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:42889:157"/>
there is no ſuch thing as ſuch an enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much leſs any permanent ſtate of it, and then</p>
                  <p>I may eaſily defend Religion as to this point; for then it is but reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that our deſires ſhould be calm and temperate, and that we ſhould ſit down content with ſuch eaſie and obvious pleaſures as ſuit this ſtate of imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and child-hood; and if ſo, what harm can Chriſtianity do men? (as God expoſtulates with his People, <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie againſt me wherein have I wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee</hi>) It doth not forbid us to <hi>like</hi> but <hi>dote;</hi> it doth not forbid us to <hi>enjoy</hi> the World, but it forbids us to <hi>equal</hi> it with <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when it hath once fixt the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of worldly happineſs aright, it is ſo far from driving us out of the reach of it, that it is the onely path to it; we ſail within thoſe Sea marks, which if we ſlight we daſh on Rocks and Sands, for</p>

What aſtoniſhment and dread will ſeize upon every Soul which hath hardened it ſelf againſt the Goſpel of Chriſt! how miſerably fool'd and cheated, will all the gay and jolly Sinners find themſelves! But glory, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and peace will be the portion of every one, who worketh righteouſneſs.</p>
